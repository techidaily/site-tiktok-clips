Whether you love it or hate it, you must have heard about an App in 2020 - TikTok. Due to the outbreak of Covid-19, TikTok became one of the fastest-growing apps on both the App Store and Google Play. Teenagers are obsessed with it, but their parents don’t understand it. The government fears it, but companies eager to make money off it. TikTok probably has been the most controversial (and prevalent) social network ever.

What makes TikTok different? Initially, Tiktok is famous for its 15-second short videos, and most of the videos are lip-syncing videos. Gradually, it evolved into a community mixed with music, lip-syncing, and micro-video content. Besides providing access to an impressive music library, the app also offers a rich selection of video editing tools, which makes videos go viral quickly.

However, the US government has threatened to ban TikTok in the US recently after it had been banned in India. The growing uncertainties of TikTok has driven so many users to look for **TikTok alternatives**. In this article, we will go through some of the best options available to both iPhone and Android users.

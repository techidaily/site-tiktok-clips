## Part 1: What is Siri Voice?

Siri voice in TikTok is basically an automated voice feature where the voice reads out the text on the video. The feature is called text-to-speech. So, whenever you enable it on your video, the text will be read out loud, which makes the video watching experience fun. Therefore, those who want to add a voice to their TikTok videos can use the text-to-speech feature and let the automated voice do that talking.

You will find almost everyone using it, even those who often use their voice in TikTok videos, and that's because many TikTok users find it entertaining and funny. Well, no matter why you want to use this feature, find out **how to do Siri voice on TikTok** without any hassle in the next part!

## Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?

To do Siri voice on TikTok, you will have to follow just a few simple steps. Here are the steps that you need to take care of:

**Step 1:** Launch TikTok on your mobile phone.

**Step 2:** Start recording a video; else, upload an already recorded video.

**Step 3:** Tap the Upload button and then click on the checkmark.

**Step 4:** Now, begin writing something on the screen.

**Step 5:** Tap on the text you have just written, and you will see the Text-to-Speech option.

**Step 6:** Click on that and hear the automated voice reading your text. Now, upload the videos, and that's it. All done!

## Part 3: Don't Like the Siri Voice on TikTok? Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps

If you are not impressed with the Siri voice on TikTok and would instead like to use some other fun and peppy voice for the text, the good news is there are tons of apps that can help you do that. But before we share the names of the apps, let's throw some light on why people are looking for such apps. First, if you are using TikTok's text-to-speech feature in North America, you will hear a computer-automated female voice who will read out the text of the video.

But, when it comes to the UK, the app uses a computer-generated male voice with a rockin' accent instead of a female voice. However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.

If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.

Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.

With TikTok’s future uncertain in the U.S., should you switch to Triller for social video creation? Here’s a handy guide on **Triller vs TikTok**.

On August 6, 2020, President Donald Trump announced that he would take steps to ban TikTok - the popular short-term video app from operating in the USA, unless the app’s US operations were sold to an American company. With a rising tide of uncertainties surrounding TikTok’s future in the United States, TikTokers and short-form video creators are getting drawn to rival platforms like Triller.

The Trump administration and other critics of TikTok fear that the data the app collects in its US users might end up in the hands of the Chinese government. However, TikTok has said that it stores users’ data outside China and that it would resist any attempts by Beijing to grab the information.

Amid these confidentiality concerns and an impending ban imposed by the Trump administration, more and more users are now switching to Triller. In fact, as TikTok faces uncertainties between being banned or bought in the US, rival app Triller has received a big boost and attained the No.1 spot in Apple’s US App Store.

![Triller Vs Tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/triller-vs-tiktok.jpg)

## Who Uses Triller & Tiktok?

Triller, the most popular alternative to TikTok is one of the many video-led social applications that are riding a wave of anti-TikTok sentiments. In the words of Triller co-owner Ryan Kavanaugh, “We see ourselves as the adult version of TikTok”. The target audience of this music video-sharing app is between the age group of 17 to 27\. Mainly, it is popular among top streaming artists, hip hop artists, and the music industry.

On the other hand, TikTok has a strong reputation for being popular with teenagers and young adults, the GenZ. While 27% of its total users are between the age group of 13-17 years, its largest age demographics (42%) are the younger adults. So when combined, the 13-24 age group represents about 69% of the app’s user base.

## How To Make Money On The Two Apps?

Amid Triller vs. TikTok, the hunt for the better social video platform is on. Although TikTok’s fate in the US is still hanging on the balance, its popularity and usage still continue to sky-rocket in other territories.

Wondering if you should really switch to Triller or stick with TikTok, for now, to show off your brand? Read on for a quick review.

**Triller vs. TikTok: For Marketing Influencers**

TikTok is undoubtedly a better social video platform for marketing influencers worldwide in terms of reach. Wondering why? Well, in comparison to Triller’s 65m, TikTok has 800 million active users. Moreover, unlike Triller that’s available only in 50 countries, TikTok is available in 155 countries. Also, TikTok has successfully launched a generation of influencers who had started as non-celebrities.

**Triller vs. TikTok: For Brand Building**

Leveraging TikTok can be the key to increasing social brand awareness. This is because with TikTok’s audience growing BY every second, you can use the platform to build your brand. Triller also gives brands a great platform for increasing exposure and get a better share of voice on social media. Just like TikTok, Triller is a fun way for brands to promote their products in their video content.

**Triller vs. TikTok: For Advertising**

TikTok provides advertisers with several options to reach their target demographic. When TikTokers open the app, ads appear and take over the screen completely for a few seconds before it turns into an in-feed video ad. From ad creation and targeting to insight reports and ad management tools, TikTok ads offer an easy-to-use and powerful platform for businesses to advertise. On the other hand, Triller doesn’t include ads currently. Instead, it focuses on letting creators raise money from followers and advertisers as well as crowdfund.

**Triller vs. TikTok: For Content Creators**

To choose the better platform between Triller and TikTok, consider asking yourself a few questions like – What kind of content creators are you creating? Do you spend more time in conceptualizing the message of your video? Would you rather simplify the editing process or have greater flexibility in editing?

While TikTok features a range of editing tools to give content creators the flexibility of creating the content they want, Triller deploys AI to edit videos for the creator. So, with Triller, you can simply let artificial intelligence compile the best clips for creating a quality video.

### Conclusion

At a time when the internet is divided on whether they should abandon TikTok, the Trump administration approved a deal for Walmart and Oracle to acquire stakes in the US operations of TikTok, thus postponing the potential ban that was planned due to the national security concerns regarding the Chinese owned company. So, US-based TikTokers can finally sigh in relief.

In summary, both TikTok and Triller offer incredible value to their expanding user base. While TikTok specifically appears to cater to all kinds of publishers and creators, Triller is specifically focused on the artists in the music industry. Videos are all about people smiling, dancing, and having a great time. So, instead of being stressed, get creative and have as much fun as possible!

On the other hand, Triller doesn’t include ads currently. Instead, it focuses on letting creators raise money from followers and advertisers as well as crowdfund.

**Triller vs. TikTok: For Content Creators**

To choose the better platform between Triller and TikTok, consider asking yourself a few questions like – What kind of content creators are you creating? Do you spend more time in conceptualizing the message of your video? Would you rather simplify the editing process or have greater flexibility in editing?

While TikTok features a range of editing tools to give content creators the flexibility of creating the content they want, Triller deploys AI to edit videos for the creator. So, with Triller, you can simply let artificial intelligence compile the best clips for creating a quality video.

### Conclusion

At a time when the internet is divided on whether they should abandon TikTok, the Trump administration approved a deal for Walmart and Oracle to acquire stakes in the US operations of TikTok, thus postponing the potential ban that was planned due to the national security concerns regarding the Chinese owned company. So, US-based TikTokers can finally sigh in relief.

In summary, both TikTok and Triller offer incredible value to their expanding user base. While TikTok specifically appears to cater to all kinds of publishers and creators, Triller is specifically focused on the artists in the music industry. Videos are all about people smiling, dancing, and having a great time. So, instead of being stressed, get creative and have as much fun as possible!

With TikTok’s future uncertain in the U.S., should you switch to Triller for social video creation? Here’s a handy guide on **Triller vs TikTok**.

On August 6, 2020, President Donald Trump announced that he would take steps to ban TikTok - the popular short-term video app from operating in the USA, unless the app’s US operations were sold to an American company. With a rising tide of uncertainties surrounding TikTok’s future in the United States, TikTokers and short-form video creators are getting drawn to rival platforms like Triller.

The Trump administration and other critics of TikTok fear that the data the app collects in its US users might end up in the hands of the Chinese government. However, TikTok has said that it stores users’ data outside China and that it would resist any attempts by Beijing to grab the information.

Amid these confidentiality concerns and an impending ban imposed by the Trump administration, more and more users are now switching to Triller. In fact, as TikTok faces uncertainties between being banned or bought in the US, rival app Triller has received a big boost and attained the No.1 spot in Apple’s US App Store.

## Who Uses Triller & Tiktok?

Triller, the most popular alternative to TikTok is one of the many video-led social applications that are riding a wave of anti-TikTok sentiments. In the words of Triller co-owner Ryan Kavanaugh, “We see ourselves as the adult version of TikTok”. The target audience of this music video-sharing app is between the age group of 17 to 27\. Mainly, it is popular among top streaming artists, hip hop artists, and the music industry.

On the other hand, TikTok has a strong reputation for being popular with teenagers and young adults, the GenZ. While 27% of its total users are between the age group of 13-17 years, its largest age demographics (42%) are the younger adults. So when combined, the 13-24 age group represents about 69% of the app’s user base.

## How To Make Money On The Two Apps?

Amid Triller vs. TikTok, the hunt for the better social video platform is on. Although TikTok’s fate in the US is still hanging on the balance, its popularity and usage still continue to sky-rocket in other territories.

Wondering if you should really switch to Triller or stick with TikTok, for now, to show off your brand? Read on for a quick review.

**Triller vs. TikTok: For Marketing Influencers**

TikTok is undoubtedly a better social video platform for marketing influencers worldwide in terms of reach. Wondering why? Well, in comparison to Triller’s 65m, TikTok has 800 million active users. Moreover, unlike Triller that’s available only in 50 countries, TikTok is available in 155 countries. Also, TikTok has successfully launched a generation of influencers who had started as non-celebrities.

**Triller vs. TikTok: For Brand Building**

Leveraging TikTok can be the key to increasing social brand awareness. This is because with TikTok’s audience growing BY every second, you can use the platform to build your brand. Triller also gives brands a great platform for increasing exposure and get a better share of voice on social media. Just like TikTok, Triller is a fun way for brands to promote their products in their video content.

**Triller vs. TikTok: For Advertising**

TikTok provides advertisers with several options to reach their target demographic. When TikTokers open the app, ads appear and take over the screen completely for a few seconds before it turns into an in-feed video ad. From ad creation and targeting to insight reports and ad management tools, TikTok ads offer an easy-to-use and powerful platform for businesses to advertise. On the other hand, Triller doesn’t include ads currently. Instead, it focuses on letting creators raise money from followers and advertisers as well as crowdfund.

So, US-based TikTokers can finally sigh in relief.

In summary, both TikTok and Triller offer incredible value to their expanding user base. While TikTok specifically appears to cater to all kinds of publishers and creators, Triller is specifically focused on the artists in the music industry.

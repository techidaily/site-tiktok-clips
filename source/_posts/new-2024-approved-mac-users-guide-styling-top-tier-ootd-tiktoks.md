Have you ever watched Jujutsu Kaisen? It is a Japanese manga series that got a lot of fame recently. A massive fan of anime might recognize the anime series for its intriguing fight sequences. Recently we have seen a huge trend of Jujutsu Kaisen videos on TikTok where she says "Anime is Trash," and suddenly the scene turns into an anime fight scene. Technically, this is the filming term "jump cut." You would likely want to create your own of these videos after watching them.

If you are one of the Jujutsu Kaisen fans and looking to create your TikTok montage, then you just landed on the right page. You can easily make such videos by using a video editor like Filmora X. In this article, we will walk through the steps involved in creating Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok montage videos. Now you can create your own scenes and connect them with Jutusu Kaisen fight scenes. Trust me, this is so much fun while editing it.

## **Step By Step Guide For Creating Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok Videos**

It requires two things to produce such videos. First, you need an idea for making the first part of the video, where you are engaged in some type of activity, or the video involves some kind of interaction with others. Second, you need a clip from the anime that goes along with the first part of the video and justifies the action you perform in the first part of the video. You can create these videos in three simple steps.

---

---

#### Step1: Download The Anime Clip From the Internet

The first thing you need is the anime footage that you want to use in your video. There are plenty of scenes that you can create, but you have to choose wisely. You can search on the internet, and you will find plenty of websites from where you can download these anime videos. The best exercise for selecting the video clip is, keep watching videos and if you find something interesting, download that clip.

#### Step2: Shoot Your Own Clip

Once you have selected a clip from the anime series, you have to make your own video that matches the scene you selected from the anime video. If there are two characters in anime, then you may also need two characters to make your own video. In TikTok videos, you may have seen two characters with a girl saying "Anime is trash" and a boy punching her, and then abruptly, the scene changes to Jujutsu Kaisen fight scene.

The punching scene is just an example, but you can come up with your own creative scenes that you can connect with anime clips and make interesting videos. Make sure to keep some points in your mind when shooting video,

* Keep the camera stable and make sure there are no shakes in your video. You can use a tripod for this purpose or fix your camera somewhere to keep it stable. Avoid recording video by holding the camera in your hand.
* The video angle should be correct, and it should be according to the anime footage. For example, if the punching person is on the right side of anime footage, you should follow the same sequence.
* It is recommended that the video be shot in sufficient natural light, but artificial lights may also be used.
* It is crucial to use a high-quality camera when making videos. You can do this with a smartphone or camera, and you should make sure you are filming in 1080p. Low-quality video will not perform well.

#### Step3: Edit and Connect both Clips

Once you have both video clips, the next step is editing the video and joining them to create a fantastic scene. For this purpose, we will use the Filmora X video editing software, which is both easy to use and one of the best video editing programs. To edit your videos, follow the steps given below:

1. Download Filmora X video editor from their official website, install it on your computer if it is already installed, and then run the program to start video editing.
2. Go to file, and click on import media and then click on import media files.![jujutsu1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu1.png)

3. Now select both clips and import them to Filmora X.![jujutsu2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu2.png)
4. Drag and drop your own video and bring it to the first track. Then drag and drop the anime video and place it next to your video in the track.![jujutsu3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu3.png)
5. You may need to make some adjustments to both video clips so that the scenes perfectly match each other. The most important step in creating videos matches the sound where a person says, "Anime is trash," and then the action happens.
6. Play the video to make sure everything is in position. If you feel that it still requires adjusting, then go back to the previous step and make the needed adjustments.
7. Music is critical to match to make the video looks smooth. Find your music to make them fit perfectly. For example, matching the hard beat with the punch or turning up the volume when the anime shows would be good ideas.
8. Once everything is perfectly aligned, your video is ready, and now you need to export it.

## **Step By Step Guide For Creating Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok Videos**

It requires two things to produce such videos. First, you need an idea for making the first part of the video, where you are engaged in some type of activity, or the video involves some kind of interaction with others. Second, you need a clip from the anime that goes along with the first part of the video and justifies the action you perform in the first part of the video. You can create these videos in three simple steps.

---

---

#### Step1: Download The Anime Clip From the Internet

The first thing you need is the anime footage that you want to use in your video. There are plenty of scenes that you can create, but you have to choose wisely. You can search on the internet, and you will find plenty of websites from where you can download these anime videos. The best exercise for selecting the video clip is, keep watching videos and if you find something interesting, download that clip.

#### Step2: Shoot Your Own Clip

Once you have selected a clip from the anime series, you have to make your own video that matches the scene you selected from the anime video. If there are two characters in anime, then you may also need two characters to make your own video. In TikTok videos, you may have seen two characters with a girl saying "Anime is trash" and a boy punching her, and then abruptly, the scene changes to Jujutsu Kaisen fight scene.

The punching scene is just an example, but you can come up with your own creative scenes that you can connect with anime clips and make interesting videos. Make sure to keep some points in your mind when shooting video,

* Keep the camera stable and make sure there are no shakes in your video. You can use a tripod for this purpose or fix your camera somewhere to keep it stable. Avoid recording video by holding the camera in your hand.
* The video angle should be correct, and it should be according to the anime footage. For example, if the punching person is on the right side of anime footage, you should follow the same sequence.
* It is recommended that the video be shot in sufficient natural light, but artificial lights may also be used.
* It is crucial to use a high-quality camera when making videos. You can do this with a smartphone or camera, and you should make sure you are filming in 1080p. Low-quality video will not perform well.

#### Step3: Edit and Connect both Clips

Once you have both video clips, the next step is editing the video and joining them to create a fantastic scene. For this purpose, we will use the Filmora X video editing software, which is both easy to use and one of the best video editing programs. To edit your videos, follow the steps given below:

1. Download Filmora X video editor from their official website, install it on your computer if it is already installed, and then run the program to start video editing.
2. Go to file, and click on import media and then click on import media files.![jujutsu1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu1.png)
3. Now select both clips and import them to Filmora X.![jujutsu2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu2.png)

4. Drag and drop your own video and bring it to the first track. Then drag and drop the anime video and place it next to your video in the track.![jujutsu3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu3.png)
5. You may need to make some adjustments to both video clips so that the scenes perfectly match each other. The most important step in creating videos matches the sound where a person says, "Anime is trash," and then the action happens.
6. Play the video to make sure everything is in position. If you feel that it still requires adjusting, then go back to the previous step and make the needed adjustments.
7. Music is critical to match to make the video looks smooth. Find your music to make them fit perfectly. For example, matching the hard beat with the punch or turning up the volume when the anime shows would be good ideas.
8. Once everything is perfectly aligned, your video is ready, and now you need to export it.
9. Click on the export button and select the desired video format from the list, i.e. (MP4, Gif, WMV, FLV, etc.).![jujutsu4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu4.png)

10. Once you have selected the desired format, click on export, and the video will take some time to render. Once rendered, you can now share the video with your friends and wow them. ![jujutsu5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu5.gif)

Conclusion: These are some simple steps using which you can create your own Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok Montage. Now it's up to you to create new ideas and make interesting videos. We recommend using the Filmora X video editor because it is easy to use and can do wonders for you. Even if you don't have any prior experience in video editing, you can follow these steps and create amazing videos. It may take some time, but you will get better eventually.

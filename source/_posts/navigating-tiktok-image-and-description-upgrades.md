## Part 1: Does TikTok Tell You Who Viewed Your Profile?

The answer is NO. TikTok lacks a feature that allows users to see which accounts have viewed their videos. It means that while you may not see who is viewing your videos, your viewing habits are also left anonymous. Thus, you wouldn't be able to access the TikTok profile view.

TikTok only indicates how many people viewed the post instead of showing who has viewed your videos profile.

TikTok users can see who comments on their videos as well as who creates "duets" or "stitches" (essentially video edits) of their content using the **Activity** tab on the app.

## Part 2: How to View Someone's TikTok Profile without them Knowing?

To view someone's profile without them knowing, you need to upgrade to the latest updated TikTok app. TikTok will only indicate the number of viewers but no further information on who those viewers are.

It means you are already viewing others' TikTok profiles without them knowing.

## Part 3: How to Change Profile Picture on TikTok

You've got only two ways to represent yourself on TikTok with your profile picture and videos. Of course, the profile picture you put shows up on the profile page and every video posted.

Like many other apps, your profile icon can get changed whenever you feel like it. TikTok has an added advantage since it gives more options for changing your icon. You can have a profile video.

Additionally, there's an easy way to download a profile picture you like on someone else's profile.

On the already updated TikTok, it is impossible to change the profile picture on PC because it is limited. The only possible way to make changes is through an Android or iOS device. However, if using a PC and need to make those changes, you can use TikTok on BlueStacks with zero troubles.

BlueStacks acts as an android emulator, which enables the running of the TikTok mobile app on the PC. You will only need to save the video or image on BlueStacks by using the option 'Save to Album.' For all this to be possible, first update the graphics driver and allocate a minimum of 1500MB RAM. After opening the app, navigate to the 'App Centre' then sign in with your Google account. Type 'TikTok' and then click it to install and open at the search option.

## Part 1: Does TikTok Tell You Who Viewed Your Profile?

The answer is NO. TikTok lacks a feature that allows users to see which accounts have viewed their videos. It means that while you may not see who is viewing your videos, your viewing habits are also left anonymous. Thus, you wouldn't be able to access the TikTok profile view.

TikTok only indicates how many people viewed the post instead of showing who has viewed your videos profile.

TikTok users can see who comments on their videos as well as who creates "duets" or "stitches" (essentially video edits) of their content using the **Activity** tab on the app.

## Part 2: How to View Someone's TikTok Profile without them Knowing?

To view someone's profile without them knowing, you need to upgrade to the latest updated TikTok app. TikTok will only indicate the number of viewers but no further information on who those viewers are.

It means you are already viewing others' TikTok profiles without them knowing.

## Part 3: How to Change Profile Picture on TikTok

You've got only two ways to represent yourself on TikTok with your profile picture and videos. Of course, the profile picture you put shows up on the profile page and every video posted.

Like many other apps, your profile icon can get changed whenever you feel like it. TikTok has an added advantage since it gives more options for changing your icon. You can have a profile video.

Additionally, there's an easy way to download a profile picture you like on someone else's profile.

**Steps to change your profile picture on TikTok**

You can pick a photo you have saved or take a new one when you change your picture. Make sure you've kept the image you wish to upload before proceeding.

Step 1: Open TikTok and head to your profile by tapping the Profile option in the bottom-right corner.

Step 2: Tap the Edit profile option.

Step 3: Select either **Change photo** or **Change video**, depending on what you want. If you're changing the photograph, you can take a new one or select the one you had saved earlier; if you're adding a video, choose the one you've saved already.

## Beyond Boundaries: How to Validate Your TikTok Video Rights

So, you have successfully created an awesome TikTok video with the perfect dance moves and accurate lip-sync. But what’s this? Your video gets muted or taken down! What a bummer!

The reason?

Copyright infringement, or in simple words, using music without the permission of the singer!

This includes external sounds that are not a part of the TikTok library.

So, what should we do to avoid this, you ask?

To avoid this, you need to learn how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading.

And, in this article, we will tell you exactly why you need to follow TikTok copyright, and how to check it before posting a video.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## **Why Do You Need to Follow Tiktok Copyright?**

To avoid getting banned!

You see, TikTok has a vast library of sounds with proper legal authorization that is available for the users to use in their videos. However, sometimes people use their own music in the videos.

The external sound may or may not be copyrighted.

If it does not have any copyrights on it, all is good. But in case you accidentally use a copyrighted video, TikTok automatically detects it, and either mutes your video or takes it down entirely. If the copyright is detected while posting, the platform will prevent you from uploading it in the first place.

To be on the safe side, we recommend using sounds already present in the TikTok library.

But, what if you want to use an external sound? Is there a way to check TikTok video copyright before uploading?

Yes, there is! And in the next section, we will tell you all about it.

## **Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading**

Whenever you’re posting a video to TikTok, you get the option of running a copyright check on it. But this option is only available on desktop browsers.

Therefore, if you’re posting a sound other than one from TikTok’s library, you can check if it’s copyrighted or not from your PC.

Here’s how:

**Step 1**

Go to the website version of [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/) from Chrome, and click on “Log In” at the top-right corner of the page. You can also click on “Log In” under the “Following” option on the left.

## **Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading**

Whenever you’re posting a video to TikTok, you get the option of running a copyright check on it. But this option is only available on desktop browsers.

Therefore, if you’re posting a sound other than one from TikTok’s library, you can check if it’s copyrighted or not from your PC.

Here’s how:

**Step 1**

Go to the website version of [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/) from Chrome, and click on “Log In” at the top-right corner of the page. You can also click on “Log In” under the “Following” option on the left.

**Step 2**

You will get a popup asking you to either sign up to Tiktok or log in using your email, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple, or Instagram. You can choose whichever option you find convenient.

## Make a TikTok video Easily using Filmora

If you look at the built-in video editor of the TikTok app, you will notice that the interface is not user-friendly at all. But this does not mean there is no way to make a TikTok music video. Filmora is an advanced video editor for both Mac and PC that has many features that make it a great choice for TikTok videos. We'll walk you through the process:

**Step 1:** First of all, make sure that the latest version of Filmora Video editor is downloaded on your computer. If you haven't already installed it, you can easily download it from the official website of Wondershare.

**Step 2:** Now, Install the application and run it on your computer.

**Step 3:** A window will appear on your screen where you need to select the new project option.

**Step 4:** In the next step, you need to select the aspect ratio. Keep in mind that by default, the aspect ratio will be 16:9, which is landscape, but since the TikTok videos are in portrait orientation, we need to select 9:16 and click ok.

**Step 5:** Now, you can import the media files to your Filmora library. Just click on the file, select import media, and click on the Import media files. Now select the video files that you want to edit, and they will be imported to your Filmora Library.

**Step 6:** Now, drag the videos from the Library and drop them to your timeline. Once you have the videos in your timeline, you can perform all the edits that you want to perform.

**Step 7:** If you want to add effects to your videos, then you can explore the effects section of Filmora, where you can find hundreds of cool effects to make your videos more interesting. If you like any effect and want to apply it to your video, drag the effect and drop it on the video track in the Filmora timeline.

**Step 9:** If you are making a TikTok reaction video using Filmora, then you can easily play two videos side-by-side. You need to place two different videos in two different tracks in Filmora. Then select the first video and adjust the size of the video so that it covers the half area in the preview window. Then repeat the septs to cover the other half of the preview window. By doing this, you can easily make a reaction video in just a few minutes.

**Step 10:** You can add your favorite music to the background of your videos. Just import the music file to Filmora and add it to the music track in the timeline. Adjust the length of the music according to the length of the video, and it will be added to the background. You can also use the volume controls to adjust the loudness.

**Step 11:** Once you are satisfied with your video, all you need to do is export it to your system in your desired format and share it with your audience on TikTok.

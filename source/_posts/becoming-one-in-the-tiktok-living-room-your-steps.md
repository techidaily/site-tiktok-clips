Once the app appears in the search results, click on it and proceed to click on the **Install** button. Click **Accept** in the pop-up window to give the app access to the computer's camera. And then after the TikTok app is installed, click on the **Open** button.

Once you sign in with your Google account, you can proceed to install the app on your computer. The steps for installing TikTok on PC and Mac computers are the same, so you just need to find the app in the Google Play Store and click on the **Install** button.

## The Desktop TikTok Creator's Handbook 2023 Edition

With the increasing trend of using Tiktok to make viral videos, every other person out there is trying their hand at this video-sharing platform. However, while Tiktok itself has many effects and editing options, there are some limitations. For instance, you cannot use the time-lapse effect on Tiktok, or you cannot make a video exceeding 60 seconds.

It becomes difficult to go all out with your videos with these limitations. Therefore, a third-party or external video editor is necessary to make better and different videos.

In this article, we will go over different ways how to create successful Tiktok videos on Desktop, Android, and iPhone.

If you want to make your video more exciting and different from the rest, you can always go for an external video editor, like Wondershare Filmora, and edit videos on your desktop. I hope our steps on how to create successful Tiktok videos on desktop, Android, and iPhone will come in handy and increase your Tiktok followers!

You don't need to invest so much time thinking about creating. That is the simplest way of getting your video viral. If that still sounds difficult, you can use one of these 20 TikTok captions ideas in one of your videos.

After posting the video, please take a minute and go back to confirm whether you have done it right without forgetting to include an excellent TikTok username. Also, don't forget to go through some of your best videos, like dances or anything you like.

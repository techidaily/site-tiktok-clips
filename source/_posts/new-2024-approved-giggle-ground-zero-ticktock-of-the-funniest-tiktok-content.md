The appeal of the Japanese food trend on TikTok is twofold. Firstly, it offers a way to explore different flavors and textures that may not be totally familiar.

Som popular Japanese food TikTok include:

### ● Sushi

Sushi is perhaps the most popular Japanese dish outside of Japan. It consists of cooked vinegared rice combined with other ingredients, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes tropical fruits. It’s mostly served with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce.

### ● Shabu Shabu

### ● Kaiseki

![“TikTok African Food](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/popular-food-recipes-5.png)

The continent of Africa is so big that it's hard to generalize about its cuisine, or even to group its cuisines into categories. Even within individual countries or regions, you will find an astonishing variety of foods and flavors.

But there are some common themes that run through most African cuisines:

### ● Jollof rice

Nigerian jollof rice is one of the country's most popular dishes, and it's become a staple on TikTok. Jollof rice is a rice dish made with tomatoes, green peppers, onion, and spices like ginger, garlic, paprika, and black pepper.

It can be served as a side dish or as a meal with additional ingredients. Some users have added sausages and fried plantains to their jollof rice before serving.

### ● Suya

It’s another popular African food called TikTok. Suya is a snack that can be found all over Nigeria and West Africa. It consists of skewers of meat covered in peanut butter and spices like ginger powder, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, salt, vegetable oil, and bouillon cubes. The meat can be made from any cut of beef or chicken but traditionally uses beef steak or chicken thigh filet.

### ● Fufu

Fufu is a soft white dough made from cassava or yams flour (also known as cassava flour). It may also be made from plantain or cocoyam. Fufu is normally eaten with stews and soups like Peanut Soup in Ghana, Egusi Soup in Nigeria, etc.

### ● Braai

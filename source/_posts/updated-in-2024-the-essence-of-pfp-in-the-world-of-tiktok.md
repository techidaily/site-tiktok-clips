### 1\. Great Stability

Holding a mobile phone for live streams can be hectic and tiring. Moreover, it won't offer camera stability, and the end result can be shaky. By using a computer, you don't have to hold anything. With great stability and ease, you can conduct live streams for a longer run.

iOS and Samsung devices provide high video quality. However, if you are using low-end smartphones, you won't get high video and audio quality.

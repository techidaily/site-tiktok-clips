### 1\. Create New Project and Set Preferences

Start Wondershare Filmora on your Windows or Mac PC, go to **File**  \> **New Project** and click **9:16 (Portrait)**  from the submenu that appears.

Click **Split Screen** from the standard toolbar at the top, hover mouse to the screen type preset you want to use, click the **\+**  ( **Add to Project** ) icon that appears at the bottom-right corner of the thumbnail, and click **OK**  from the bottom-right corner once the preset is added to the Timeline.

### 2\. Import and Add Video(s) Preview/Timeline

Click the **Media** button from the standard toolbar, click anywhere inside the **Media** window at the upper-left corner, and when the **Open** box comes up, select and import the video file(s) you want to participate in the **TikTok reaction**. Alternatively, you can also click **Record** from below the standard toolbar, and choose any of the options to record your own video or voice right from within Wondershare Filmora itself.

Next, click and drag each of the imported videos to their corresponding screen sections in the **Preview** window in the upper-right area. Notice how the files are automatically added to the Timeline at the bottom.

### 3\. Add Elements and Titles

Click **Elements** from the standard toolbar, hover mouse to the element you want to add to the reaction, click the **\+**  icon that appears at the center of the thumbnail, and reposition the element in the Timeline to match the duration with that of the reaction you are creating.

### 4\. Export the Reaction

![Filmora9  export options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-video.jpg)

Click **EXPORT**  from the top-middle section of the interface, go to the **Local** tab from the top of the **Export** box that appears next, select your preferred format from the left bar, optionally choose a destination folder from the right window, optionally click **SETTINGS**  to fine-tune the output preferences as needed, and click **EXPORT**  from the bottom-right corner to export the **TikTok reaction**. Or, you can save it in the settings perfect for iPhone or another device.

Below is a sample reaction video made with Filmora, you can do much better than that for your TikTok account:

Besides using Filmora to edit reaction videos with the split-screen presets, you can also use some other [video editing software to create a reaction video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Filmora can empower your video creation with more creativity, watch the video below and download Filmora to try.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Conclusion**

A **TikTok reaction** enables you to make the source videos more fun and entertaining. Luckily the app itself has a “React” button that helps you create **TikTok reaction videos** with merely a few simple taps. However, if you feel that the built-in options are not as robust as they should be, a third-party program like Wondershare Filmora is something you would definitely love to try your hands on as the software is not only easy to use, it is also lightweight, and doesn’t put any overhead on your computer hardware.

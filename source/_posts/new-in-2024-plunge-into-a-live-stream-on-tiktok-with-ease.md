No, it is not possible to stitch a video for longer than five seconds using the built-in Stitching feature of the TikTok app. But this can be done by stitching the videos using third-party applications and software.

**3\. How do I see TikTok stitches?**

Users who want to view as many stitches as possible can do it by browsing for them on the app. You must first browse to **Discover,** and from there to the search box. Then type **#Stitch @username,** where the **username** is the name of the account from which you wish to view stitches.

**4\. TikTok Stitch option not showing. How to fix it?**

Users may choose whether or not someone else can Stitch their work in their settings. The option may be found under the **Settings** and **Privacy** tab, where users can activate or uncheck Stitch for all videos. So, if the Stitch option is not showing, the user may have disabled the Stitch option.

**Conclusion**

The Stitch feature is an excellent way to continue the discussion with your videos. You may leave comments on popular content on the site. Most importantly, it may be a fun method to generate material different from what you usually publish. And since you know **How to Stitch on TikTok** after reading this article, stitch the videos today and create unique content!

You can even trim the soundtrack by clicking on the scissor icon and trim it according to your preference. You can even pick a song before recording and mimic that song. There are also video speed options which can help you adjust the speed of your video and soundtrack making it slower or faster

 After that, you can apply filters and even video effect. There is a vast range available which will make your video more creative and fun.

 When you’re completely done with the video, you can select a cover or thumbnail for your video and you are all ready to upload.

Fame is a very fickle friend. Anyone can go viral and become TikTok famous by gaining more likes, lots of views, and video shares. TikTok’s algorithm can put your videos at the top of the “For You” scroll and turn you into a sensation overnight, thus skyrocketing your followers count in a matter of few days. But, did you know that TikTok removed almost 50 million videos in just 6 months because those videos violated its rules?

While this social media site can easily be your shot to fame, it can even take away your audience. Or worse, it can ban you from using the app if you do not follow its community guidelines and rules. And, if you’ve been on TikTok for a while now, chances are you’ve heard about users getting ‘shadowbanned’. It’s not unusual for users to unknowingly stop receiving likes, views, and traffic on their accounts due to **TikTok shadowban**.

Ever since the influx of social media, shadow banning, also known as ghost banning or stealth banning, has been around. It comes up when content has been blocked or partially blocked. Sadly, when your TikTok account is shadowbanned, it will negatively affect your reach and halt your growth. Influencers and businesses rely on social media to create a community. And when they lose a part of that community, they feel a loss of support.

Wondering what shadowbanning entails, how to determine if you’ve been shadowbanned, and **how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok**? Check out below.

## Part 1: What is a Shadowban On TikTok?

The word “shadowban” is relatively self-explanatory. Basically, it means your account has been banned. But, the shadow part of the term means that you won’t know about the ban.

Shadowban on TikTok is a restriction that prevents your videos from appearing on the **For You** page or on hashtag results. It is a situation where your visibility has been reduced or where you have been banned from the platform, without your knowledge.

The act of shadowbanning a TikTok account is an automatic process done by TikTok’s algorithm to protect other users against spam content, copyright issues, and adult content. When you get shadowbanned, you stop receiving likes, views, and traffic from the For You page. Often, shadowbans go unnoticed until another user who stumbled upon your video points it out.

## Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?

At the early stages of TikTok, shadowbans lasted for 24 hours. But, with the latest update in the TikTok algorithm, the length of TikTok shadowban is growing. Nowadays, a TikTok account is shadowbanned for approximately up to 2 weeks.

Within the first week, there will be a drop in your followers and so will the views. After a few days of the account shadowban being in place, you won’t be able to enter any tags or make new videos on TikTok unless they are public.

![tiktok shadowban](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-shadowban.png)

## Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?

The TikTok app doesn’t ever actually tell if you are shadowbanned. But, if you are then you can probably notice it. If you are shadowbanned, your videos will neither show up on the TikTok “For You” page nor will they appear when you search them via hashtag.

During a TikTok shadowban, your videos and content will not:

* be visible in the search results
* be visible on the feed
* receive new followers
* receive likes from others
* receive comments from others

## Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?

TikTok has not issued any explanation on its shadowbanning techniques. However, what makes complete sense is that TikTok shadowbans its users for creating videos that violate its community guidelines.

Any video with offensive content that can harm the sentiments of people or anything that can trigger other users can attract TikTok shadowban. The app might limit the visibility of your content for reasons such as your account acting as spam or you are posting inappropriate content.

![shadowbanned on tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shadowbanned-on-tiktok.png)

**Spam Behavior**

The primary reason why a user’s TikTok account can get shadowbanned is that they behave like a spammer. Usually, new people go on a spree of liking and following people in the hope that they will like and follow back. However, TikTok might recognize this behavior as spam and consider you as a robot.

If you like more than 100 posts daily, you might want to slow down. If you follow more than 50 TikTok accounts in a day, it is best to re-evaluate that strategy.

**Inappropriate Content**

Posting videos that go against the TikTok rules and community guidelines can get you shadowbanned or permanently banned.

The following content is considered inappropriate by TikTok:

* hate speech
* fake news
* violence
* nudity
* drugs
* copyrighted music

TikTok is committed to make its platform an inclusive and safe space. So, if you have experienced a drop in views or engagement, consider reassessing your recent content.

## Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?

Wondering about how do you get unshadowbanned on TikTok? Here’s what you can do to remove your shadowban:

#### Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok

Firstly, delete your recent video. If it doesn’t work, uninstall and then reinstall the TikTok app. Sometimes, your app might just need an update to become functional once again.

#### Switch to A Pro Account

When doing a Google search on how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok, the most common tip you’ll find is to go into the Settings of your TikTok account and tap “Switch to a Pro Account”. The reason is that making the switch will allow you to see analytics for your posts and find out how people access your videos. By doing this, you can easily monitor how far your engagement has increased or dropped.

![tiktok pro account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-pro-account.jpg)

#### Delete Offensive Content

You should delete content that goes against the rules and community guidelines laid down by TikTok. After deleting inappropriate content, you have to wait for at least two weeks to get the shadowban lifted. You can refresh your device once in a while to check if you have finally managed to lift the ban.

#### Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime

Once you have deleted offensive content, clear the cache, close your app, ensure it is updated and then take a break from TikTok for a few days. Coming back after you have cleaned up your account and taken the needed break might get you unshadowbanned on TikTok.

#### Post Original, Innovative Content

When you return to posting content, you need to make sure your TikTok account doesn’t get shadowbanned again. Your account has already been flagged for something and so you need to try even harder to behave. If you go back to posting the same kind of content that got you banned in the first place, you will be booted off the stage again.

Ensure you always post original content with innovative ideas. Brainstorm new ideas with your team and come up with something new and unique. This way, you can avoid copyright infringement laws on TikTok.

#### Know Your Audience More

These days, there are many kids and minor accounts on TikTok, and maintaining a healthy environment is a part of your responsibility. Keep your videos free from sexualized themes, nudity, pornographic material, and suggestive themes. Remember; posting such content can land you in serious trouble with TikTok shadowban.

Fame is a very fickle friend. Anyone can go viral and become TikTok famous by gaining more likes, lots of views, and video shares. TikTok’s algorithm can put your videos at the top of the “For You” scroll and turn you into a sensation overnight, thus skyrocketing your followers count in a matter of few days. But, did you know that TikTok removed almost 50 million videos in just 6 months because those videos violated its rules?

While this social media site can easily be your shot to fame, it can even take away your audience. Or worse, it can ban you from using the app if you do not follow its community guidelines and rules. And, if you’ve been on TikTok for a while now, chances are you’ve heard about users getting ‘shadowbanned’. It’s not unusual for users to unknowingly stop receiving likes, views, and traffic on their accounts due to **TikTok shadowban**.

Ever since the influx of social media, shadow banning, also known as ghost banning or stealth banning, has been around. It comes up when content has been blocked or partially blocked. Sadly, when your TikTok account is shadowbanned, it will negatively affect your reach and halt your growth. Influencers and businesses rely on social media to create a community. And when they lose a part of that community, they feel a loss of support.

Wondering what shadowbanning entails, how to determine if you’ve been shadowbanned, and **how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok**? Check out below.

## Part 1: What is a Shadowban On TikTok?

The word “shadowban” is relatively self-explanatory. Basically, it means your account has been banned. But, the shadow part of the term means that you won’t know about the ban.

Shadowban on TikTok is a restriction that prevents your videos from appearing on the **For You** page or on hashtag results. It is a situation where your visibility has been reduced or where you have been banned from the platform, without your knowledge.

The act of shadowbanning a TikTok account is an automatic process done by TikTok’s algorithm to protect other users against spam content, copyright issues, and adult content. When you get shadowbanned, you stop receiving likes, views, and traffic from the For You page. Often, shadowbans go unnoticed until another user who stumbled upon your video points it out.

## Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?

At the early stages of TikTok, shadowbans lasted for 24 hours. But, with the latest update in the TikTok algorithm, the length of TikTok shadowban is growing. Nowadays, a TikTok account is shadowbanned for approximately up to 2 weeks.

Within the first week, there will be a drop in your followers and so will the views. After a few days of the account shadowban being in place, you won’t be able to enter any tags or make new videos on TikTok unless they are public.

![tiktok shadowban](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-shadowban.png)

## Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?

The TikTok app doesn’t ever actually tell if you are shadowbanned. But, if you are then you can probably notice it. If you are shadowbanned, your videos will neither show up on the TikTok “For You” page nor will they appear when you search them via hashtag.

During a TikTok shadowban, your videos and content will not:

* be visible in the search results
* be visible on the feed
* receive new followers
* receive likes from others
* receive comments from others

## Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?

TikTok has not issued any explanation on its shadowbanning techniques. However, what makes complete sense is that TikTok shadowbans its users for creating videos that violate its community guidelines.

Any video with offensive content that can harm the sentiments of people or anything that can trigger other users can attract TikTok shadowban. The app might limit the visibility of your content for reasons such as your account acting as spam or you are posting inappropriate content.

![shadowbanned on tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shadowbanned-on-tiktok.png)

**Spam Behavior**

The primary reason why a user’s TikTok account can get shadowbanned is that they behave like a spammer. Usually, new people go on a spree of liking and following people in the hope that they will like and follow back. However, TikTok might recognize this behavior as spam and consider you as a robot.

If you like more than 100 posts daily, you might want to slow down. If you follow more than 50 TikTok accounts in a day, it is best to re-evaluate that strategy.

**Inappropriate Content**

Posting videos that go against the TikTok rules and community guidelines can get you shadowbanned or permanently banned.

The following content is considered inappropriate by TikTok:

* hate speech
* fake news
* violence
* nudity
* drugs
* copyrighted music

TikTok is committed to make its platform an inclusive and safe space. So, if you have experienced a drop in views or engagement, consider reassessing your recent content.

## Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?

Wondering about how do you get unshadowbanned on TikTok? Here’s what you can do to remove your shadowban:

#### Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok

Firstly, delete your recent video. If it doesn’t work, uninstall and then reinstall the TikTok app. Sometimes, your app might just need an update to become functional once again.

#### Switch to A Pro Account

When doing a Google search on how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok, the most common tip you’ll find is to go into the Settings of your TikTok account and tap “Switch to a Pro Account”. The reason is that making the switch will allow you to see analytics for your posts and find out how people access your videos. By doing this, you can easily monitor how far your engagement has increased or dropped.

![tiktok pro account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-pro-account.jpg)

#### Delete Offensive Content

You should delete content that goes against the rules and community guidelines laid down by TikTok. After deleting inappropriate content, you have to wait for at least two weeks to get the shadowban lifted. You can refresh your device once in a while to check if you have finally managed to lift the ban.

#### Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime

Once you have deleted offensive content, clear the cache, close your app, ensure it is updated and then take a break from TikTok for a few days. Coming back after you have cleaned up your account and taken the needed break might get you unshadowbanned on TikTok.

#### Post Original, Innovative Content

When you return to posting content, you need to make sure your TikTok account doesn’t get shadowbanned again. Your account has already been flagged for something and so you need to try even harder to behave. If you go back to posting the same kind of content that got you banned in the first place, you will be booted off the stage again.

Ensure you always post original content with innovative ideas. Brainstorm new ideas with your team and come up with something new and unique. This way, you can avoid copyright infringement laws on TikTok.

#### Know Your Audience More

These days, there are many kids and minor accounts on TikTok, and maintaining a healthy environment is a part of your responsibility. Keep your videos free from sexualized themes, nudity, pornographic material, and suggestive themes. Remember; posting such content can land you in serious trouble with TikTok shadowban.

# How to Use Text to Speech on TikTok - A Complete Guide

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Ever since its arrival, TikTok has been a dominant force in the world of social media. A mix of lip sync videos, music, and micro-video content, TikTok is extremely popular with Gen Z. Over the years, TikTok has continued to enhance the user experience by adding new features, effects, and guidelines.

Text-to-speech is one of the newest features to be added to the popular platform and it provides an additional way to add something innovative to the video uploads. Announced in December 2020, **text to speech on TikTok** lets creators put their text over their videos and have a Siri-like voice read it out loud.

TikTok’s text-to-speech feature was added to make the platform accessible to more people by providing an easy way for text to be heard as well as read. Consequently, using this option in video creation is one way that content creators can ensure their videos appeal to a larger number of viewers, while also offering a more comprehensive experience in general.

Since its launch, the feature has been going viral. Many find the automated voice to be a selling point in itself and something that adds a different element to the content. Also, it is a great way to get a message across without actually speaking during the video. No matter the reason it is used, the fact that many are turning to text-to-speech makes it a great addition to TikTok.

Wondering how to get the text to speech on TikTok for your next video? Here’s a detailed insight into this new feature.

* [Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?](#part3)
* [Part 4: How to Customize the Text-To-Speech Voice On TikTok?](#part4)

## Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?

In December 2020, TikTok began rolling out a new text-to-speech feature that automatically turns text into a voiceover as users watch videos that have the feature enabled. The popular social media platform included the new option as an accessibility feature for users with impaired vision, a growing trend for apps integrating voice technology.

Simply put, text to speech on TikTok allows video content creators to convert any piece of text they put on top of their video into a Siri-sounding voice. This means that whatever you type will be read out loud in a robotic tone, eliminating the need for you to narrate. It is a useful way to explain your videos to add context, describe what’s happening, or serve the purpose you see fit.

![text-to-speech tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/text-to-speech-tiktok.jpg)

There are numerous reasons why you might decide to use this option. Firstly, it’s a great alternative for users who can’t or don’t want to use their own voice in videos. Perhaps you’re shy or just wish to keep an air of anonymity. Or, you might have a speech impediment, or communicate non-vocally or non-verbally. Either way, this feature offers a great alternative way to narrate to viewers.

Also, there are several benefits this feature provides to the audience. Some of your viewers may have poor eye-sight, might struggle to read, or are blind. Using text to speech on TikTok will help you make sure that they can still interact with your video.

Making your video more accessible means that you will get better engagement, which is a win-win situation for you. Lastly, many TikTokers use the text-to-speech option for comedic or dramatic effects.

## Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?

Recently, TikTok changed the voice on its text-to-speech feature to a new, more energetic, and upbeat voice. This is because of a lawsuit filed by professional voice actor Beverley Standing against ByteDance – the parent company of TikTok. Standing had sued ByteDance in mid-May for using her voice in the text-to-speech setting without her permission.

The lawsuit of the voice actor states that she was hired to work in 2018 for the state-backed Chinese Institute Of Acoustics research body to use in translations and that TikTok has used them without paying her and it has caused damage. She said she hadn’t authorized the use of her voice beyond the use for translations.

The lawsuit concerns the English-language voice used in North America. TikTok videos made prior to the change still feature the old tone. Although TikTok is yet to comment on the new voice or Standing’s lawsuit, the timing of the changes is very suggestive.

## Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?

Are you puzzled about how to get text to speech on TikTok? Check out the step-by-step guide below without any further ado!

#### Step 1: Update Your TikTok to The Latest Version

First things first, ensure your TikTok is updated to the latest version so that you have the TikTok text-to-speech function. Many people have the natural human tendency to push updates as far as technologically possible. But, if you are perplexed about how to do text to speech on TikTok, ensure you have the latest version of this social media app before anything else.

![latest version tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/latest-version-tiktok.jpg)

#### Step 2: Start Recording a Video

Take into account what you wish to say beforehand and have a rough idea of how quickly you want it to be read as the text to speech entry can be as long as your video. After you have the video recording you want to add the text over, press the checkmark on the lower right-hand corner of your app’s screen.

![start-record video tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/start-record-video-tiktok.jpeg)

#### Step 3: Enter Your Text

Next, tap the text icon at the bottom of your screen and type the text you’d like to be read aloud. Ensure you keep in mind the length. Once you have entered the text, tap ‘**Done**’ in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. This will insert a customizable text box over your video.

![enter text tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/enter-text-tiktok.png)

#### Step 4: Tap On the Text, Choose Text-To-Speech

When it comes to using text to speech on TikTok, this is another crucial step.Once you enter the text into the TikTok video, tap the Textbox and you will have three options: Text-to-Speech, Set Duration, and Edit. Select Text-to-Speech and the inbuilt text-to-speech AI of TikTok will read your text over the video.

![tap-text-to speech tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tap-text-to-speech-tiktok.png)

#### Step 5: Save the Video Locally

It is here that you will venture outside TikTok to change the text-to-speech voice. Once your video is ready in every other way, consider saving it locally on your device and not post it for everyone to see. Ensure the “**Save to Device**” option is active and you can post it privately.

![save-to device tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/save-to-device-tiktok.jpg)

#### Step 6: Download A Video Editor with Voice Modifiers

Next, you have to download a video editor – ideally for your smartphone – with voice modifiers. Adding ‘video’ into the search keywords alongside ‘Voice Modifier’ or ‘Voice Changer’ will bring up a list of options. Remember; many voice changers or free editors will either block the option to save edited videos onto the device behind a paywall or leave a watermark.

#### Step 7: Edit the Video and Resave

Once you have chosen your video editor, launch it and import your saved TikTok video. Here, you can edit the audio just like any other video, and voice modifiers can be applied if the video editing tool you choose has them. Apply different effects you’d like and resave your new and modified TikTok video to your device.

#### Step 8: Upload as A New Video to TikTok

Open the TikTok app and upload the new, edited TikTok as a singular video directly, without any further edits. You will get a TikTok video with a customized text-to-speech voice for all intents and purposes.

![save-to device tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/save-to-device-tiktok.jpg)

#### Step 6: Download A Video Editor with Voice Modifiers

Next, you have to download a video editor – ideally for your smartphone – with voice modifiers. Adding ‘video’ into the search keywords alongside ‘Voice Modifier’ or ‘Voice Changer’ will bring up a list of options. Remember; many voice changers or free editors will either block the option to save edited videos onto the device behind a paywall or leave a watermark.

#### Step 7: Edit the Video and Resave

Once you have chosen your video editor, launch it and import your saved TikTok video. Here, you can edit the audio just like any other video, and voice modifiers can be applied if the video editing tool you choose has them. Apply different effects you’d like and resave your new and modified TikTok video to your device.

#### Step 8: Upload as A New Video to TikTok

Open the TikTok app and upload the new, edited TikTok as a singular video directly, without any further edits. You will get a TikTok video with a customized text-to-speech voice for all intents and purposes.

Ever since its arrival, TikTok has been a dominant force in the world of social media. A mix of lip sync videos, music, and micro-video content, TikTok is extremely popular with Gen Z. Over the years, TikTok has continued to enhance the user experience by adding new features, effects, and guidelines.

Text-to-speech is one of the newest features to be added to the popular platform and it provides an additional way to add something innovative to the video uploads. Announced in December 2020, **text to speech on TikTok** lets creators put their text over their videos and have a Siri-like voice read it out loud.

TikTok’s text-to-speech feature was added to make the platform accessible to more people by providing an easy way for text to be heard as well as read. Consequently, using this option in video creation is one way that content creators can ensure their videos appeal to a larger number of viewers, while also offering a more comprehensive experience in general.

Since its launch, the feature has been going viral. Many find the automated voice to be a selling point in itself and something that adds a different element to the content. Also, it is a great way to get a message across without actually speaking during the video. No matter the reason it is used, the fact that many are turning to text-to-speech makes it a great addition to TikTok.

Wondering how to get the text to speech on TikTok for your next video? Here’s a detailed insight into this new feature.

* [Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?](#part2)

* [Part 4: How to Customize the Text-To-Speech Voice On TikTok?](#part4)

## Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?

In December 2020, TikTok began rolling out a new text-to-speech feature that automatically turns text into a voiceover as users watch videos that have the feature enabled. The popular social media platform included the new option as an accessibility feature for users with impaired vision, a growing trend for apps integrating voice technology.

Simply put, text to speech on TikTok allows video content creators to convert any piece of text they put on top of their video into a Siri-sounding voice. This means that whatever you type will be read out loud in a robotic tone, eliminating the need for you to narrate. It is a useful way to explain your videos to add context, describe what’s happening, or serve the purpose you see fit.

![text-to-speech tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/text-to-speech-tiktok.jpg)

There are numerous reasons why you might decide to use this option. Firstly, it’s a great alternative for users who can’t or don’t want to use their own voice in videos. Perhaps you’re shy or just wish to keep an air of anonymity. Or, you might have a speech impediment, or communicate non-vocally or non-verbally. Either way, this feature offers a great alternative way to narrate to viewers.

Also, there are several benefits this feature provides to the audience. Some of your viewers may have poor eye-sight, might struggle to read, or are blind. Using text to speech on TikTok will help you make sure that they can still interact with your video.

Making your video more accessible means that you will get better engagement, which is a win-win situation for you. Lastly, many TikTokers use the text-to-speech option for comedic or dramatic effects.

## Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?

Recently, TikTok changed the voice on its text-to-speech feature to a new, more energetic, and upbeat voice. This is because of a lawsuit filed by professional voice actor Beverley Standing against ByteDance – the parent company of TikTok. Standing had sued ByteDance in mid-May for using her voice in the text-to-speech setting without her permission.

The lawsuit of the voice actor states that she was hired to work in 2018 for the state-backed Chinese Institute Of Acoustics research body to use in translations and that TikTok has used them without paying her and it has caused damage. She said she hadn’t authorized the use of her voice beyond the use for translations.

The lawsuit concerns the English-language voice used in North America. TikTok videos made prior to the change still feature the old tone. Although TikTok is yet to comment on the new voice or Standing’s lawsuit, the timing of the changes is very suggestive.

## Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?

Are you puzzled about how to get text to speech on TikTok? Check out the step-by-step guide below without any further ado!

#### Step 1: Update Your TikTok to The Latest Version

First things first, ensure your TikTok is updated to the latest version so that you have the TikTok text-to-speech function. Many people have the natural human tendency to push updates as far as technologically possible. But, if you are perplexed about how to do text to speech on TikTok, ensure you have the latest version of this social media app before anything else.

![latest version tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/latest-version-tiktok.jpg)

#### Step 2: Start Recording a Video

Take into account what you wish to say beforehand and have a rough idea of how quickly you want it to be read as the text to speech entry can be as long as your video. After you have the video recording you want to add the text over, press the checkmark on the lower right-hand corner of your app’s screen.

![start-record video tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/start-record-video-tiktok.jpeg)

#### Step 3: Enter Your Text

Next, tap the text icon at the bottom of your screen and type the text you’d like to be read aloud. Ensure you keep in mind the length. Once you have entered the text, tap ‘**Done**’ in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. This will insert a customizable text box over your video.

![enter text tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/enter-text-tiktok.png)

#### Step 4: Tap On the Text, Choose Text-To-Speech

When it comes to using text to speech on TikTok, this is another crucial step.Once you enter the text into the TikTok video, tap the Textbox and you will have three options: Text-to-Speech, Set Duration, and Edit. Select Text-to-Speech and the inbuilt text-to-speech AI of TikTok will read your text over the video.

## Part 1: Why are TikTok Dances Popular around the World?

By far, the highly famous or popular TikTok dances with 29.7 million-plus users attempting the quick-paced choreography are the "renegade", as mentioned earlier. However, it's perhaps one of the primary viral dances to break out of the app’s confines itself and influence multiple other TikTokers to strive to be trending all over.

You need to understand the anatomy of this TikTok 2022 dance going famous along with its strategies to know how a TikTok dance can become popular around the globe.

The original dance was by Atlanta-based 14-year-old Jalaiah Harmon in September 2019 and promptly fueled up with middle and high school students. Given the song "Lottery" by K Camp, Harmon's dance has been observed in talent shows and at school pep rallies for TikTok competitions.

Here's a girl named Kara Leigh Cannella, who is a senior dance major at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia

She was scrolling through TikTok one day this fall when she came across a sound that grabbed her attention. It was called HOOPLA, a 15-second clip by the user known as @kyleyoumadethat, and it promptly made her wish to dance.

She began by improvising, as she often does while choreographing for TikTok. Between famous moves like the Woah and the Wave, she mimed releasing a basketball into the air and dribbling it between her legs, reflecting sound themes (which samples the song "Basketball" 2002 Lil Bow Wow ).

"Then I cleaned up the moves," she says, "because I was like, 'I don't want to make this too hard.' "

Cannella, 22, had struck an excellent balance for TikTok dance virality though she was not aware of it yet: something rhythmically satisfying and eye-catching but still accessible, not beyond the real amateur dancers. She showed the dance in her bathroom and posted it with a call to "try it and tag me."

To her surprise, by the following day, the video received 10,000 likes, and soon the dance was all around the TikTok platform, also tried by the app's most-followed user, a 16-year-old dancer, Charli D'Amelio. She posted it for her then-95 million followers.

So, this was the overall pick behind popular TikTok dances 2022, which you can observe that there's no such rocket science in letting dance become highly trending.

Dance has always found a social media audience, but TikTok, more so than other platforms, has given a boom to its own highly recognizable, simply reproducible style.

Being inspired from a lexicon of hip-hop–inspired moves—like the Dougie, Throw It Back, and the Dice Roll, to name just a few—the micro TikTok dance songs 2022 are generally front-facing most animated from the hips up.

They specifically cater to the smartphone screen vertical frame. Governed by time limits between 15 to 60 seconds, they also tend to preserve in a single place; you can do them anywhere pretty much.

While many professional dancers display their hard-earned TikTok skills, the app, globally released in 2018, has become recognized as a space where everyone is for dance.

"It's not about having the perfect dance body; it doesn't matter if you're a pro," says Alessandro Bogliari, the Influencer Marketing Factory's CEO, a company that ramps within SMM campaigns. "It's about re-creating and having certain funny moves."

She began by improvising, as she often does while choreographing for TikTok. Between famous moves like the Woah and the Wave, she mimed releasing a basketball into the air and dribbling it between her legs, reflecting sound themes (which samples the song "Basketball" 2002 Lil Bow Wow ).

"Then I cleaned up the moves," she says, "because I was like, 'I don't want to make this too hard.' "

Cannella, 22, had struck an excellent balance for TikTok dance virality though she was not aware of it yet: something rhythmically satisfying and eye-catching but still accessible, not beyond the real amateur dancers.

## Part 2: Benefits of Going Live on TikTok with Computer

There are various advantages of going live on TikTok with a PC. By doing so, you can ensure a better quality of your live streaming session. To learn more, let's discuss the details.

### 1\. Great Stability

Holding a mobile phone for live streams can be hectic and tiring. Moreover, it won't offer camera stability, and the end result can be shaky. By using a computer, you don't have to hold anything. With great stability and ease, you can conduct live streams for a longer run.

### 2\. High Video/Audio Quality

iOS and Samsung devices provide high video quality. However, if you are using low-end smartphones, you won't get high video and audio quality. In such a circumstance, you should use your computer to maintain better quality. By doing so, your audience can listen and view your live streams flawlessly.

Live streams on mobile phones restrict you from displaying a variety of content simultaneously. Through your PC, you can do live streaming on TikTok while playing your favorite games. You can easily open multiple windows on your PC during live streams. Moreover, you can have a picture-in-picture display to use a webcam while going for a live stream.

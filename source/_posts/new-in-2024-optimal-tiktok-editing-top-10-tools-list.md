# Best TikTok Video Editing Apps \[Updated\]

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Becoming an instant online celebrity with millions of followers has never been easier. This trend started on [YouTube](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and has spread to other social media like [TikTok](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [Instagram](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). TikTok has already conquered the Asian market, but in recent years this video-sharing and social networking app is becoming popular across the globe.

Standing out from TikTok isn’t as easy as you thought, because you will face fierce competition, and you must do everything you can to improve the quality of the content you share on TikTok. So, in this article, we will look at the best TikTok video editing apps that will enable you to produce content that attracts millions of viewers.

## How to Use the TikTok’s Built-in Video Editing Tools

In addition to viewing the content posted by other TikTok users, the app lets you record and edit videos. The video editing tools you are going to have at your disposal are basic but still powerful enough to enable you to enhance the 15 and 60-second videos you capture with TikTok.

To start making a new video, you have to tap on the + icon that is located at the bottom of the app’s home screen and then tap on the red Video button on the app’s Shooting page. Before you start recording, tap on the Add a Sound option if you would like to choose a song or an audio effect you would like to add to a video you’re creating.

Moreover, the app lets you [control the video’s playback speed](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), apply filters and effects or activate the Beauty mode before you start shooting. As we already noted, a video you record with TikTok cannot be longer than 60 seconds. Hence, after you capture your comedy sketch or create a music video, you’ll be able to [apply stickers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), voice or sound effects, filters, and visual effects or add [text layers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Each video you create with TikTok is different, which means that you have to try out different options in order to get the most out of the footage you record with this app. In addition, you can trim videos that are longer than 15 seconds and [adjust the volume](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) of a video’s original sound or the volume of its soundtrack.

The set of video and audio editing tools TikTok app provides can limit your options during the video editing process, but you can easily solve this issue by tapping on the Upload button that is located in the bottom right corner of the Shooting page.

This option enables you to use a video editing app that offers more advanced video editing tools to polish your videos before you upload them to TikTok. Once you are done editing, you can proceed to [add the description of the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and choose if you want to enable comments, reactions, or give your followers the option to create duets.

## Best Video Editing Apps for Creating TikTok Videos

The video editing options TikTok offers are not versatile enough to allow you to perform complex video editing tasks. That is why a growing number of TikTok’s users opt for third-party apps that are equipped with the tools they can use to [improve the quality of the content](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) they share on this social network. Here are some of the [best video editing apps you can use on iOS](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or Android devices, as well as Mac and PC computers to create videos you share on TikTok.

* [1. iMovie](#imovie)
* [2. Adobe Rush](#adobe)
* [3. Timbre](#timbre)
* [4\. FUNIMATE](#funimate)
* [5. VIZMATO](#vizmato)
* [6\. Splice](#splice)
* [7. Filmmaker Pro Video Editor](#filmmaker)
* [8. Filmora](#filmora)

### 1\. [iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193)

**Available for:** macOS, iOS

**What we like:**

* Free and easy to use
* Rich music and audio effect library
* Fully customizable trailer templates and themes

Over the course of the last two decades, iMovie has become one of the most reliable video editing apps for iPhone, iPad and Mac users who don’t have advanced video editing skills. iMovie lets you choose from 14 trailer templates and 8 themes so that you can easily [combine multiple video clips](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and create a soundtrack for them.

Additionally, this video editor for iOS and macOS devices grants you access to all the tools you are going to need to cut your footage, [create PIP](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or [green screen effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or record voiceovers for each video you edit with iMovie. All of these features make this video editor a perfect choice if you want to create short TikTok videos.

**Cons:**

* Adding your own music to projects you create in iMovie is not possible
* Lacks advanced video editing options

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. [Adobe Rush](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html)

**Available for:** Windows, macOS, Android, iOS

**What we like:**

* Sharing videos to TikTok directly from Adobe Rush
* Cross-platform availability
* Compatible with Adobe’s professional video editing software products

You don’t have to be a [video editing professional](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to record and edit videos with Adobe Rush since this cross-platform app makes it easy to create short social media videos. Adjusting a video’s aspect ratio, [applying color grading effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or using some of the app’s motion graphics templates are just a few among numerous options you’ll have if you decide to install this app.

Additionally, you can adjust the Exposure, Vibrance or Shadows values in all video clips you import into a project you created in Adobe Rush. However, the free version of the app offers only limited capabilities and you must opt for a monthly or annual subscription model if you would like to expand the cloud storage space or export an unlimited number of videos each month.

**Cons**

* The app is not available in all parts of the world
* You can only export 3 videos per month with the free version of the app

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. [**Timbre**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xeus.timbre&hl=en)

**Available for:** Android

**What we like:**

* Supports all common audio and video file formats
* Equipped with audio and video converters
* Adjusting video and audio playback speed is easy

![ Timbre: Cut, Join TikTok Videos ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/timbre-cut-join-tiktok-videos.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Cutting or converting audio and video files is what Timbre was designed for. TikTok content creators in need of an app that allows them to [create GIFs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or remove any part of an audio or video clip should consider installing this app for Android phones

Besides changing the format of your audio and video files Timbre also enables you to [customize the bitrate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) of those files and reduce their size. However, there isn’t much more you can do with Timbre other than merge, trim, cut or[compress video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and audio clips, as applying visual effects, adding text layers or adjusting the brightness and contrast values of your footage is not possible with this app.

**Cons**

* No built-in audio library
* Previewing a video before exporting it is not an option

Creating smooth short videos for TikTok is much easier if you can [apply transitions between two clips](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or add real-time music video effects to them.

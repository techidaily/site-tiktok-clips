It is a social media platform where users post short 15 seconds video clips. The video ranges from dance challenges to pranks. In fact, you will also find videos of pets dressed funnily.

TikTok is a social media network that had a meteoric rise. The platform saw a significant rise in creative short sketches that are similar to Vine skits. This platform is popular for its lip-synching and act-out memes by sound clips and music that are remixed and reproduced among its users.

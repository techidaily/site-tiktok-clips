The technology behind TikTok is pretty much flawless. If the website is not working, then we would recommend:

2. If the website is still is not loading then go to the browser’s settings and clear out related caches and cookies.

If you are facing some other kind of problem then you can always directly contact the support team at TikTok.

The process of finding your friend or someone else on the TikTok website is not all that difficult. The creators of the platform have tried their best to make the interface user-friendly. If you know the user ID then:

2. If the friend that you are looking for also uses Facebook then you would be able to find and connect with them easily.

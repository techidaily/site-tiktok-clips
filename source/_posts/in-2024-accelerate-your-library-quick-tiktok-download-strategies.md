All you have to do is launch the TikTok app from your phone and tap on the **Account icon** that is located in the bottom right corner of the app's main window.

The download will start immediately after you tap on the **Download icon**, and the video will be saved to your phone's camera roll.

## Method 2: Using the Video Downloader Apps to Download other TikTok Videos

The process of downloading videos to a Smartphone directly from the TikTok app can be quite slow, so if you want to save videos from this video sharing platform to your phone in no time you can try using some of the downloader apps for Musical.ly that are available at the Google Play store.

### Downloading TikTok Videos With the Video Downloader for Musical.ly

Once you've installed the [Video Downloader for Musical.ly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avalon.musically.downloader) on your phone, you should open the TikTok app and locate the video you want to save.

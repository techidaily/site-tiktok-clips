Following its meteoric increase in popularity, most users expressed a desire to utilize it on their PC to connect with friends and explore new musical and video compositions by like-minded individuals. This is why TikTok made significant improvements in its PC version. The majority of the features formerly restricted to mobile applications can now be accessed using a web browser.

In addition, you can simply fast forward and rewind video recordings on a computer with relative ease. To learn more, just follow these easy steps:

**Step 1:** Log in to your TikTok account by going to the TikTok website on your PC.

**Step 2:** Once you're on the home page, click on any video that you may wish to view.

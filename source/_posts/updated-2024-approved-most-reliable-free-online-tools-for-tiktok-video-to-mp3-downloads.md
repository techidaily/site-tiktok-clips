### 3.Edit TikTok with Adobe Rush

One of the greatest advantages of using Adobe Rush is that it doesn’t require users to have advanced video editing skills. With the ease of this cross-platform app, it is easy to create short social media videos for platforms like TikTok.

Some of the key features of this editor include the application of color grading effects, adjustment of video's aspect ratio, and use of the app's motion graphics templates. Moreover, users can adjust the shadows, exposure, and vibrance in all the video clips that they import into a created project in Adobe Rush.

Pros:

* Supports all Mac devices
* Cross-platform availability
* Compatibility with Adobe’s professional video editing software products
* Ability to share videos directly to TikTok from Adobe Rush

Cons:

* The app is available globally
* Users can export only 3 videos in a month using the free app version

### 4.Make TikTok Video with [BeeCut](https://beecut.com/)

Another popular video editor for both Windows and Mac users, BeeCut is free software with a very simple interface. Having very powerful and exciting video editing functions, users can edit their TikTok videos using the cool filters, overlays, elements, transitions, PIP effects, and other interesting TikTok effects.

Additionally, it supports up to five aspect rations including 4:3 (traditional), 3:4 (Taobao video), 1:1 (Instagram video), 16:9 (widescreen), and 9:16 (portrait). Those who do not have advanced video editing skills can also use it easily on Mac and create stunning videos to entertain their followers.

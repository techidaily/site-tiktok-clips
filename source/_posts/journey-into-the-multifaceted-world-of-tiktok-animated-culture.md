Although adding text to video would need video editing software, you can use a powerful yet easy to use editor such as Filmora. With this video editor's various cutting-edge editing tools, adding and customizing texts in TikTok videos becomes a breeze. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through how to use Filmora to add text overlay to video.

**Step 1:** To go to the main screen of Filmora, select **New Project**. When entering the **Project Settings** box, we recommend modifying options such as _aspect ratio_ and _frame rates_.

**Step 2:** To modify your video clips, _drag & drop_ them from the **Media Library** to the **Timeline** panel.

**Step 3:** To access the **Text & Title** settings, go to the **Titles** tab. Filmora includes over 200 text effects that span various genres, including _lifestyle, media, seasonal, opener, bottom third_, and end _credits_. In the **Preview** window, double-click the **Titles** setting to see the outcome.

### 6\. Restart the Devices

If TikTok works on another device or browser from the list above, your device seems to be the issue. If the issue continues, consider deleting the program and reinstalling it from the App Store for iOS users or Play Store for Android users. The first thing to do in the case of an application problem on your iPhone device is to switch off then on again. To achieve this, these are the steps to follow:

**For iOS:**

* To begin, touch and hold the Power button until you receive the “Slide to Power Off” option on your screen. Then move the slider to the right until the screen on your iPhone or iPad becomes dark.

* Wait at least 10 seconds after shutting off your iPhone before hitting and holding the Power button until the Apple logo shows on the screen.

## Part 4: Conclusion

Sometimes all that TikTok needs is an update.

If none of the alternatives above work, remove your **TikTok app** according to your device. Go to the App Store or Google Play Store. Search for the **TikTok** **application** and install it. If you are on an Android smartphone, go to the Play Store, search for TikTok, and check if there is an update available. For an iOS device, visit the App Store, press on your profile symbol, then scroll down to check if there's an update. Summing up, these are the few reliable ways to fix your **TikTok bugs** handily.

Part 2\. Types of TikTok Bugs Leads to TikTok Not Working

On TikTok’s side, the TikTok issues might be caused by glitches or flaws in the software. There may also be an issue with TikTok’s server resulting in TikTok problems. Regular updates generally solve issues on the TikTok app. Some mistakes are more prevalent than others. While others emerge relatively infrequently. Although, the more familiar the issue, the more readily it may be rectified. However, for unusual TikTok issues, you need to become more technical or obtain assistance from official sources like customer support. TikTok faults might come from both your side and from TikTok.

### 1\. Fix TikTok Bugs on Android

The major cause of this condition is excessive video watching. As a consequence, TikTok collects additional caches, which are kept in the phone memory. As result, there is not enough capacity to conserve phone data, hence TikTok videos are slow, and there are crashing and hanging difficulties.

The remedy to this issue is to clean the TikTok app's caches and data. This approach is based on the steps indicated below:

* Launch the TikTok app.
* Go to your profile page and select one of the three possibilities indicated by three dots.

![Click Three Dots](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/tiktok-bugs-1.jpg)

* Then pick the option to clean caches. Following these easy procedures will swiftly cure your issue.

### 2\. Fix TikTok Not Working on iPhone

To begin, we suggest resetting the **TikTok iOS** app as a general approach. Temporary difficulties that emerged during the app’s functioning may be fixed with a simple restart. As a consequence, these app problems might be to fault for any troubles with getting into your TikTok account. Plus, this is an excellent step to attempt after other changes to begin a fresh new session of the TikTok platform.

To Restart Your **TikTok iOS App**:

* First, close the TikTok app entirely by deleting it from your Recent Apps or App Switcher.
* Then, from your homepage, reopen the TikTok app.

### 3\. Fix TikTok Bugs on Chrome

Alternatively, you may try going to TikTok.com in a web browser (ideally on another device) and check whether it loads and operates correctly. If it does not, chances are that the problem is not with your phone and there is an outage of some type.

![Login Tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/tiktok-bugs-3.jpg)

* First, try shutting the app completely altogether and relaunching it. This looks to be a simple remedy for some customers.

* If comments still aren’t functioning after a restart, users can try logging out and back in.
* As a final option, you may remove the software totally and re-download it for a reinstall.

### 4\. Clear TikTok App Cache

If your TikTok app is not operating, it's probably an issue with damaged cache data. If you notice, your TikTok app plays certain videos offline when you start it. It's not magic. The cache memory saves certain data temporarily to let the software operate quicker and function effectively. If your TikTok is acting improperly, deleting the cached data may help solve it. Follow the instructions below to do so.

* Launch the Settings app from your app menu, then click on the Apps & Notifications.

* From there, click on the option to see all applications. Usually "App details", "Manage Applications", or "See all apps".

![Storage and Cache](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/tiktok-bugs-4.jpg)

* After showing the list of applications on your phone, select TikTok and launch it. Tap Storage & cache on the TikTok app information screen.

![Clear Cache](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/tiktok-bugs-5.jpg)

* Finally, press Clear cache to delete the stored data. Now touch the back button once and tap on the Force stop button to quit the TikTok app. After that, re-launch the TikTok app to see whether it rectifies the issue or try another method below.

### 5\. Reset the Network

TikTok has become a very frequently used app globally, however occasionally its users have to confront certain challenges. Sometimes when viewing or recording a video, an error does not allow the app to play the video. This issue is not directly connected to the app; however, we may solve this mistake by utilizing alternative ways such as network difficulties. Sometimes our network is giving trouble to the system, and it is not supporting the videos we wish to play. So, the first and foremost duty to remove this problem is to examine our connection. To solve the connection difficulties or ISP APN, we need to take the following steps:

* Open the settings and click on the network and internet option. From there, click on the mobile network > Open ‘Advanced Options’

* Click on the access point names and select the three full stops in the upper right corner of your phone's screen.

* Then click on reset to default. After performing these instructions leave the settings, then go to your home screen and switch on the mobile data. Then play the video to see whether the fault is fixed.

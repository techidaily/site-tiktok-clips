## Unleashing Potential: Making a Mark with Desktop TikToks

With the increasing trend of using Tiktok to make viral videos, every other person out there is trying their hand at this video-sharing platform. However, while Tiktok itself has many effects and editing options, there are some limitations. For instance, you cannot use the time-lapse effect on Tiktok, or you cannot make a video exceeding 60 seconds.

It becomes difficult to go all out with your videos with these limitations. Therefore, a third-party or external video editor is necessary to make better and different videos.

In this article, we will go over different ways how to create successful Tiktok videos on Desktop, Android, and iPhone.

## **Conclusion**

Tiktok videos are not only about following the trends; in fact, you can use them to create brand awareness, market your product or services, or engage with your audience in an effective way. However, the key is to make a video worth watching! And while Tiktok’s built-in editor has many tools, it comes with certain limitations.

If you want to make your video more exciting and different from the rest, you can always go for an external video editor, like Wondershare Filmora, and edit videos on your desktop. I hope our steps on how to create successful Tiktok videos on desktop, Android, and iPhone will come in handy and increase your Tiktok followers!

## Part 1: 10 Best TikTok Filters You'd Love to Use

We will look at some of the top TikTok filters that make your video stand out from the crowd.

### 1.TikTok's G6 filter

On TikTok, filters are identified by a single maker and number. While G6 is labeled a food-related filter, it's become increasingly popular due to its bright, colorful, and slightly retro feel.

![tiktok g6 filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-g6-filter.jpg)

### 2.TikTok's Anime Filter

When individuals uploaded their Snapchat videos to TikTok, the anime filter became quite popular. This filter transforms you into an animated character, but you'll need to download Snapchat first and get an account if you don't already have one.

![tiktok anime filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-anime-filter.jpeg)

### 3.TikTok’s Invisible filter

Another outcome of viral videos is TikTok's Invisible filter. This one gives you the ability to become invisible, which is fantastic if you've ever wanted to try out that superpower.

![tiktok invisible filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-invisible-filter.jpg)

### 4.TikTok's Bling Effect

The Bling effect is another effect that is likely to appear on your For You page. This effect imitates the flash of a diamond being struck by the sun in different locations across the film.

![tiktok bling effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-bling-filter.jpg)

### 5.TikTok's Disney Effect

The Disney TikTok filter gives you a chance to experience what it's like to be a Disney princess or prince. This effect transforms your face into a Disney-inspired cartoon character.

This filter, like the anime filter, is available on Snapchat. So make sure you've downloaded that app first.

![tiktok disney effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-disney-filter.jpg)

### 6.TikTok Dog Face

The Dog Face filter is another amusing face to experiment on. You get dog ears, a nose, and even a tongue with this one. However, you must record another filter in Snapchat before publishing it to TikTok.

![tiktok dog face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-filter-dog-face.jpg)

### 7.TikTok's Inverted Filter

The Inverted filter is a little more divisive than the others. This filter flips any video you capture, and it's famous for using the front-facing camera because it's said to mimic how other people perceive you. So, what's the big deal about it? On the other hand, the inverted filter has enraged some users, who don't always appreciate their "true" reflection. However, the only way to see what all the fuss (or hysteria) is about is to give it a try.

![tiktok inverted filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-inverted-filter.jpg)

### 8.TikTok's Face Zoom effect

As the name suggests, the Face Zoom effect zooms-in on your face. Some people use it in group videos to see which face the filter lands on, while others use the same to compare how you look up close versus how you look from a distance.

![tiktok face zoom effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-face-zoom-effect.jpg)

### 9.TikTok's Face Morph

The Face Morph effect is another popular effect. This one lets you morph and transition between multiple images of someone else's face. The effect may be under TikTok's Templates area because it employs graphics rather than video.

![tiktok face morph](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-filter-face-morph.jpg)

### 10.TikTok's Beauty Filter

For obvious reasons, the Beauty filter is popular on TikTok. It improves your appearance by evening out skin tone, adding color, and improving overall appearance. It's commonly useful in conjunction with other filters and effects.

![tiktok beauty filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-beauty-filter.jpeg)

![tiktok invisible filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-invisible-filter.jpg)

### 4.TikTok's Bling Effect

The Bling effect is another effect that is likely to appear on your For You page. This effect imitates the flash of a diamond being struck by the sun in different locations across the film.

### 5.TikTok's Disney Effect

The Disney TikTok filter gives you a chance to experience what it's like to be a Disney princess or prince. This effect transforms your face into a Disney-inspired cartoon character.

This filter, like the anime filter, is available on Snapchat. So make sure you've downloaded that app first.

### 6.TikTok Dog Face

The Dog Face filter is another amusing face to experiment on. You get dog ears, a nose, and even a tongue with this one. However, you must record another filter in Snapchat before publishing it to TikTok.

![tiktok dog face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-filter-dog-face.jpg)

### 7.TikTok's Inverted Filter

The Inverted filter is a little more divisive than the others. This filter flips any video you capture, and it's famous for using the front-facing camera because it's said to mimic how other people perceive you. So, what's the big deal about it? On the other hand, the inverted filter has enraged some users, who don't always appreciate their "true" reflection. However, the only way to see what all the fuss (or hysteria) is about is to give it a try.

![tiktok inverted filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-inverted-filter.jpg)

### 8.TikTok's Face Zoom effect

As the name suggests, the Face Zoom effect zooms-in on your face. Some people use it in group videos to see which face the filter lands on, while others use the same to compare how you look up close versus how you look from a distance.

![tiktok face zoom effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-face-zoom-effect.jpg)

### 9.TikTok's Face Morph

The Face Morph effect is another popular effect. This one lets you morph and transition between multiple images of someone else's face. The effect may be under TikTok's Templates area because it employs graphics rather than video.

![tiktok face morph](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-filter-face-morph.jpg)

### 10.TikTok's Beauty Filter

For obvious reasons, the Beauty filter is popular on TikTok. It improves your appearance by evening out skin tone, adding color, and improving overall appearance. It's commonly useful in conjunction with other filters and effects.

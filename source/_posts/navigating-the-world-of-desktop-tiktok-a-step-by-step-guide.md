## Navigating the World of Desktop TikTok: A Step-by-Step Guide

With the increasing trend of using Tiktok to make viral videos, every other person out there is trying their hand at this video-sharing platform. However, while Tiktok itself has many effects and editing options, there are some limitations. For instance, you cannot use the time-lapse effect on Tiktok, or you cannot make a video exceeding 60 seconds.

It becomes difficult to go all out with your videos with these limitations. Therefore, a third-party or external video editor is necessary to make better and different videos.

In this article, we will go over different ways how to create successful Tiktok videos on Desktop, Android, and iPhone.

## **Conclusion**

Tiktok videos are not only about following the trends; in fact, you can use them to create brand awareness, market your product or services, or engage with your audience in an effective way. However, the key is to make a video worth watching! And while Tiktok’s built-in editor has many tools, it comes with certain limitations.

If you want to make your video more exciting and different from the rest, you can always go for an external video editor, like Wondershare Filmora, and edit videos on your desktop. I hope our steps on how to create successful Tiktok videos on desktop, Android, and iPhone will come in handy and increase your Tiktok followers!

1. At first, you can just go to the Photos app, open any picture, and click on the “Edit” button from the top.
2. Once the editing interface of the photo is opened, you can go to its Exposure field and set it to its maximum value, which is 100 (please note that this is an optional step).
3. Great! Now, go to the “Highlights” field and set its value to negative 35.
4. Afterward, change the “Shadow” effect to a negative 28 value and keep the “Contrast” value to minus 30.

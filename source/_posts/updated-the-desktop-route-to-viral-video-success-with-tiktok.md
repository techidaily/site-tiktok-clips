## The Desktop Route to Viral Video Success with TikTok

With the increasing trend of using Tiktok to make viral videos, every other person out there is trying their hand at this video-sharing platform. However, while Tiktok itself has many effects and editing options, there are some limitations. For instance, you cannot use the time-lapse effect on Tiktok, or you cannot make a video exceeding 60 seconds.

It becomes difficult to go all out with your videos with these limitations. Therefore, a third-party or external video editor is necessary to make better and different videos.

In this article, we will go over different ways how to create successful Tiktok videos on Desktop, Android, and iPhone.

## **Conclusion**

Tiktok videos are not only about following the trends; in fact, you can use them to create brand awareness, market your product or services, or engage with your audience in an effective way. However, the key is to make a video worth watching! And while Tiktok’s built-in editor has many tools, it comes with certain limitations.

If you want to make your video more exciting and different from the rest, you can always go for an external video editor, like Wondershare Filmora, and edit videos on your desktop. I hope our steps on how to create successful Tiktok videos on desktop, Android, and iPhone will come in handy and increase your Tiktok followers!

## Part 1: What Does PFP for TikTok Mean?

PFP is an acronym for Profile Picture. It is an obvious one. Previously, profile picture was simply known as PP but TikTok users use the acronym PFP. On other social media platforms, the acronym stands for Picture for Proof. Thus, it basically is asking a user to send proof of what they are doing. Nonetheless, they are primarily associated with IM and Snapchat apps.

As TikTok is a video-sharing platform, PFP just stands for the profile picture.

## Part 2: Why Are TikTokers Changing Their Profile Picture?

Your profile picture says a lot about you. So, you should be on top of your game when it comes to the image you are portraying to the world. There are many reasons for TikTokers to change their profile picture. However, one of the primary reasons is to get noticed.

Let’s check out the reasons why they keep changing their profile picture.

1. Whenever there is a change in their appearance or style, such as weight loss, haircut, or some cosmetic enhancements.
2. When they are actively searching for more followers.
3. If some significant event has taken place in their life.
4. When they are just tired of seeing the same picture.
5. When the profile picture isn’t representing you anymore.

## Part 3: Creative TikTok PFP Ideas to Make Your Profile Attractive

So, you want your profile to grab more followers. One way to do that is to use the best PFP for TikTok. Here are some ideas that can help you out.

### 1\. Cute PFP for TikTok

Using a cute PFP can be a great idea. But a cute DP on social media platforms has become highly conventional. Yes, you can use your own photos but it is better to have a cute-looking baby’s face. You can also choose to use an Asian girl or an anime girl. Remember, cute profile pictures aren’t just about smiling or posing beautifully in front of the camera. You need to take care of the aesthetic PFP for TikTok. So, make sure it has proper framing and a good backdrop.

### 2\. Aesthetic PFP for TikTok

Aesthetic PFP is the subject that is being searched for by the user. It should tell your followers what the profile is about. In this case, you have to decide between a brand logo and a personal photo. For instance, if it is a page on food, get an attractive photo of any food item shot. Make sure that the focus of the photo is centered. It should be as large as possible.

TikTok is a social media platform for relaxing. It entertains you. This is the reason many TikTok users share funny content. In case you are one such user, you should use a Funny profile picture. A funny picture is going to bring a smile to the face of the viewers. You can use some pictures from the internet if you don’t want to use your own picture.

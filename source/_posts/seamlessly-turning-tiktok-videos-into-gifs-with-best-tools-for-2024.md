The editing capabilities in TikTok are adequate yet rudimentary. You may upload and modify existing movies and photographs or record yourself for up to three minutes. Turn to CapCut's ShortCut option if you want a simpler TikTok or Dubsmash-style editing experience.

CapCut will question you about the movies and photographs in your photo library that you'd want to import into the composition when you're in this mode. After that, the program analyzes your video and recommends a variety of designs, which each alters the music, timing, and changes.

For instance, you may add a pop rhythm, disco groove, or urban funk flavor to your film. CapCut allows you to select from a licensed library of songs or import sounds you've recorded.

Here's how to change the voice on TikTok using Capcut:

**Step 1:** Open the **Capcut application** on your phone and I**mport** a video/audio file or record a short sample.

**Step 2**: Now tap on **Add Audio** to record a **Voiceove**r.

**Step 3:** After recording, now press on the **Checkmark** to save the sample.

**Step 4:** Now tap on the recorded area on the **Timeline** to enable the **Voice Effects**.

**Step 5:** Select the **Voice Effects** according to your liking from the given options and press on the **Checkmark** to save the video.

Becoming one of the most popular and highly favored Social Media platforms over the past several years, Snapchat is a great place to showcase 10-second snippets of your day-to-day life with your followers, friends, and family members. From selfies to shots of food, videos taken during nights on the town to holiday adventures, Snapchat is the perfect video and image-sharing platform for Social Media fans.

## How to screenshot on snapchat without stimulating a notification?

An incredible application that allows you to send and share videos and images with friends and followers, Snapchat is designed to help you stay connected in more ways than one. Featuring an anti-screenshot notification system that automatically notifies posters when a recipient or audience member screenshots a snap, it’s become increasingly harder to screenshot without being detected.

That being said, there are still plenty of other methods that offer a practical alternative to ensure you avoid that awkward automated notification.

#### Option 1. Use Another Phone or Mobile Device to Take Snapchat Screenshot

An easy and risk-free way to capture and store a specific snap with ease, utilizing another mobile device or camera is a great method that requires very little effort. Simply us a second phone, or a nearby tablet, to record the whole duration of the video or photo.

Although the quality of the recording won’t be as crisp and clear as it appears on the handheld, this is a reliable and fool-proof way to preserve those special snaps. From those video recordings, you should then be able to crop out the video or image you needed.

Missed it?

Why not take advantage of Snapchat’s “replay” mode to ensure you get the perfect shot – but be warned, posters also get notified of this too.

#### Option 2. Use the Built-In Screen Recoding Tool on iOS11

If you didn’t already know, there’s a built-in screen recording software within iOS11 that allows you to effectively capture and record snaps with ease. Lying within the Settings of any iPhone, follow these easy steps on how to live record your screen:

* Step 1: Head to Settings > Control Centre > Customize Controls
* Step 2: Locate the “Screen Recording” functionality
* Step 3: Select the small cross to add it to your Control Centre
* Step 4: To activate – Tap the icon with the 2 concentric circles to start recording. To complete a recording, simply tap the red bar that’s present at the top of the screen and select “End Recording”.

Although it’s not possible to start recording a snap whilst it’s already open, it’s best to start recording before you opt to open a specific message.

Please note: If you have updated to Snapchat version 10.17.5, the posters will be notified each and every time you initiate and capture a recording through the use of this built-in recorder.

#### Option 3. Use QuickTime Screen Capture on a Mac

A little more technical than simply using another mobile device to record a snap, using the QuickTime Player is an efficient and high-quality method for those looking to secretly store a snapchat post.

To start recording snaps, follow these simple steps:

* Step 1: Connect your iPhone to your Mac
* Step 2: Open the QuickTime Player application
* Step 3: Select **File > New Movie Recording** from the menu
* Step 4: Once loaded, simply hover the mouse beside the recording button. By clicking the small arrow, you’ll be provided with a range of different recording options
* Step 5: Select your Phone as the **Movie Recording Input**

Once connected, your Mac screen should now be mirroring your mobile device. Just like you would on your phone, simply hit record and head on over to the Snapchat application to begin recording.

#### Option 4. Use the Mirror Feature for Android

Similar to the use of QuickTime or the iOS11 Screen Recording software, Screen Mirroring is another effective method for capturing Snapchat screenshots without the poster being made aware. By connecting a HDMI cable to both your TV and laptop, or by accessing the “Screen Mirroring” application that’s often built-in to most Smart Phones and Android devices, it’s possible to mirror/cast the active screen on your device onto an external platform.

In doing so, you’re presented with the opportunity to utilize another device to record a playing snap or even share a recently received snap with other audience members that are present in the room.

#### Option 5. Delay the Snapchat Screenshot Notification

A method for those feeling a more confident or even for those that aren’t too bothered about their posters receiving a notification in the long run, this method is a great way to delay the arrival of that pop-down notification.

To delay the notification process, follow these simple steps:

* Step 1: Load the Snapchat application on your mobile device
* Step 2: Find the snap you want to open/record (ensure it is fully loaded)
* Step 3: Turn off WiFi, Bluetooth, Mobile Data
* Step 4: Turn on the Airplane Mode
* Step 5: Open the snap and take your screenshot
* Step 6: Wait approximately 30 seconds and then turn all your connections back on

Designed to postpone the process of the poster receiving a notification, but not allowing for viewers to screenshot undetected, this method allows audience members to screenshot snaps from those that are perhaps a little unobservant when it comes to checking their notifications.

Be warned though, some posters may catch on to this method of screenshotting and they may stop sharing their videos and images with you.

## Summary

Despite there being plenty of reasons why there might be a need for you to record a Snapchat memory without the sender being made aware, it’s important to note that this can also be viewed as a breach of privacy with senders not only being informed of who has taken a screenshot, but also how many times they’ve done so and of which post.

With Snapchat designed to maintain the notion that any media sent between users is considered temporary, thanks to the 5-10 second duration limit, the methods listed above, although not fail-proof, are suggested as simple yet effective ways to avoid triggering an unwanted notification whilst using this highly popular social networking application.

A great way to share specific memories with those not on the social platform, or even for those looking to make personalized and meaningful memoir collages for their friends and loved ones, there are plenty of ways to inconspicuously screenshot on Snapchat without the sender being made aware.

Becoming one of the most popular and highly favored Social Media platforms over the past several years, Snapchat is a great place to showcase 10-second snippets of your day-to-day life with your followers, friends, and family members. From selfies to shots of food, videos taken during nights on the town to holiday adventures, Snapchat is the perfect video and image-sharing platform for Social Media fans.

## How to screenshot on snapchat without stimulating a notification?

An incredible application that allows you to send and share videos and images with friends and followers, Snapchat is designed to help you stay connected in more ways than one. Featuring an anti-screenshot notification system that automatically notifies posters when a recipient or audience member screenshots a snap, it’s become increasingly harder to screenshot without being detected.

That being said, there are still plenty of other methods that offer a practical alternative to ensure you avoid that awkward automated notification.

#### Option 1. Use Another Phone or Mobile Device to Take Snapchat Screenshot

An easy and risk-free way to capture and store a specific snap with ease, utilizing another mobile device or camera is a great method that requires very little effort. Simply us a second phone, or a nearby tablet, to record the whole duration of the video or photo.

Although the quality of the recording won’t be as crisp and clear as it appears on the handheld, this is a reliable and fool-proof way to preserve those special snaps. From those video recordings, you should then be able to crop out the video or image you needed.

Missed it?

Why not take advantage of Snapchat’s “replay” mode to ensure you get the perfect shot – but be warned, posters also get notified of this too.

#### Option 2. Use the Built-In Screen Recoding Tool on iOS11

If you didn’t already know, there’s a built-in screen recording software within iOS11 that allows you to effectively capture and record snaps with ease. Lying within the Settings of any iPhone, follow these easy steps on how to live record your screen:

* Step 1: Head to Settings > Control Centre > Customize Controls
* Step 2: Locate the “Screen Recording” functionality
* Step 3: Select the small cross to add it to your Control Centre
* Step 4: To activate – Tap the icon with the 2 concentric circles to start recording. To complete a recording, simply tap the red bar that’s present at the top of the screen and select “End Recording”.

Although it’s not possible to start recording a snap whilst it’s already open, it’s best to start recording before you opt to open a specific message.

Please note: If you have updated to Snapchat version 10.17.5, the posters will be notified each and every time you initiate and capture a recording through the use of this built-in recorder.

#### Option 3. Use QuickTime Screen Capture on a Mac

A little more technical than simply using another mobile device to record a snap, using the QuickTime Player is an efficient and high-quality method for those looking to secretly store a snapchat post.

To start recording snaps, follow these simple steps:

* Step 1: Connect your iPhone to your Mac
* Step 2: Open the QuickTime Player application
* Step 3: Select **File > New Movie Recording** from the menu
* Step 4: Once loaded, simply hover the mouse beside the recording button. By clicking the small arrow, you’ll be provided with a range of different recording options
* Step 5: Select your Phone as the **Movie Recording Input**

Once connected, your Mac screen should now be mirroring your mobile device. Just like you would on your phone, simply hit record and head on over to the Snapchat application to begin recording.

#### Option 4. Use the Mirror Feature for Android

Similar to the use of QuickTime or the iOS11 Screen Recording software, Screen Mirroring is another effective method for capturing Snapchat screenshots without the poster being made aware. By connecting a HDMI cable to both your TV and laptop, or by accessing the “Screen Mirroring” application that’s often built-in to most Smart Phones and Android devices, it’s possible to mirror/cast the active screen on your device onto an external platform.

In doing so, you’re presented with the opportunity to utilize another device to record a playing snap or even share a recently received snap with other audience members that are present in the room.

#### Option 5. Delay the Snapchat Screenshot Notification

A method for those feeling a more confident or even for those that aren’t too bothered about their posters receiving a notification in the long run, this method is a great way to delay the arrival of that pop-down notification.

To delay the notification process, follow these simple steps:

* Step 1: Load the Snapchat application on your mobile device
* Step 2: Find the snap you want to open/record (ensure it is fully loaded)
* Step 3: Turn off WiFi, Bluetooth, Mobile Data
* Step 4: Turn on the Airplane Mode
* Step 5: Open the snap and take your screenshot
* Step 6: Wait approximately 30 seconds and then turn all your connections back on

Designed to postpone the process of the poster receiving a notification, but not allowing for viewers to screenshot undetected, this method allows audience members to screenshot snaps from those that are perhaps a little unobservant when it comes to checking their notifications.

Be warned though, some posters may catch on to this method of screenshotting and they may stop sharing their videos and images with you.

## Summary

Despite there being plenty of reasons why there might be a need for you to record a Snapchat memory without the sender being made aware, it’s important to note that this can also be viewed as a breach of privacy with senders not only being informed of who has taken a screenshot, but also how many times they’ve done so and of which post.

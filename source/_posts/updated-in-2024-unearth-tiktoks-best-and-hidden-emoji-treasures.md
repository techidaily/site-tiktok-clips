## Part 1: How to Fast Forward on Tiktok When Playing?

TikTok videos include a progress bar, which allows you to jump between them; nevertheless, this feature is not accessible for all videos. For the time being, the function is only visible on lengthier films.

Although it is unlikely, it is also possible to download a TikTok clip and then fast forward or rewind it at your convenience without using the TikTok app. But how to do it is the real question here. Follow the steps below to learn the trick:

**Step 1:** Find a **white progress bar** at the bottom of the clip on TikTok by opening the app and selecting it.

![tiktok video playback white progress bar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-video-playback-white-progress-bar.jpg)

**Step 2:** The dot on the progress bar that appears like a white line may be moved forward or backward by tapping and dragging it along the bar. Note that the revised location will be reflected above the bar in the first timecode number.

![fast forward tiktok video playing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fast-forward-tiktok-video-playing.jpg)

**Step 3**: Using your finger, touch on the **White circle** and move it forward or backward to the place indicated by the timecode figure displayed above it.

**Step 4:** When you **let go of the dot**, you would have shifted your position in the clip.

## Part 2: How to Record Fast Motion Video on TikTok on iPhone and Android?

A rapid-motion movie must be recorded with an increased speed between each frame to get a faster playback speed. Videos that move at a high rate of speed have a hypnotic impact on viewers. The procedures of creating a fast-motion video in TikTok for Android are outlined in the following section.

### **Record fast motion video on TikTok Android**

**Step 1:** After launching the app, the feed area will appear. It would help if you touched on the **"+"** option in the feed area to get to the "**Add new**" section.

**Step 2:** Speed control must be enabled when adding a new option. To change the speed, use the **speed control** option in the upper right corner of the screen.

![tiktok speed option icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-speed-option-icon.jpg)

**Step 3:** The next step is to decide on the video's frame rate. The rectangular bar lets you choose a speed. Tap on the chosen speed from here.

![record tiktok fast forward options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-tiktok-fast-forward-options.jpg)

**Step 4:** You may begin recording your video after selecting the **required frame rate**. You may accomplish this by holding down the red circular **recording** option as indicated in the image below while tapping and holding.

**Step 5:** The next step is to go on to the next stage. Tap the **Red color checkmark** option in the bottom right corner as indicated in the image below to proceed. Only once you've finished recording a video will you see the **Tick** mark.

**Step 7**: The screen below will appear after selecting the next option. On this page, you'll see a **Post** button where you may share the video with your followers.

**Step 3:** Select the **ideal recording speed** at which you wish to capture your video. For a video with fast motion effect, you should choose 2X or 3X. To record a video, click on the **red circle symbol** on the screen.

## Part 4: How to Download A TikTok Video to Fast Forward on iPhone and Android?

TikTok users were not allowed to fast forward or rewind videos inside the app for the longest time. TikTok recently added this feature; however, this new feature is not accessible for all users.

So, for those of you without this feature, we have found a way around it to let you fast forward and rewind your favorite TikTok videos; download them and that too without watermark on your iPhone or Android. Here's how.

**Step 1:** Open the TikTok app, and select the video that you wish to download for fast-forwarding or rewinding.

**Step 2:** Share this video page by clicking on the arrow icon located at the bottom-right of the page. If the publisher has enabled the download feature, you'll be able to save the video to your gallery.

![save tiktok video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-tiktok-video.jpg)

**Step 3:** If you're an iPhone user, press on the **Live Photo** icon in the share tab.

![save tiktok video live photos iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-tiktok-video-live-photos-iphone.jpg)

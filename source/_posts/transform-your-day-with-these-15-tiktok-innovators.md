For that execution, you will need an external video editing app to edit your videos. [Wondershare’s FilmoraX](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is recommended to be the best video editing software used for these purposes.

3.The next step is to start the motion tracking. For this, you will need to make sure that your play head is at the point from where you want to start your motion tracking. The tracking will only start wherever your play head is.

![32motion track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/32.motion-track.jpg)

4.Once that is done, you can open the tool used for motion tracking from the timeline toolbar. You can also do it by double-clicking your clip to find the motion tracking function in the editing menu.

5.When you have done that, the motion tracking box will appear in the preview. Move and resize it according to the subject that you wish to track. Then, select the “render-effect” option so that Filmora can analyze the video.

![32box](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/32.box.jpg)

6.Now you can add the object you want to have to follow the track. You can choose that from the title menu or add a new image from your Mac.

![32import media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/32.import-media.jpg)

7.Once you choose your object, you simply need to drag that object to the track above your footage.

8.Next, you will need to place the object where you want it to be concerning the subject in the preview box. Make sure that you drag the edge of it on the timeline to match it with the timeline of your subject.

9.When it has been set up, you will need to double-click the footage you have added the tracking function to and go to the motion tracking menu.

10.The drop-down menu will show all the texts and images or animations available. Select the one you want to see.

11.Adjust the size of your object and voila!! You are done.

## Part 4: How to Download A TikTok Video to Fast Forward on iPhone and Android?

TikTok users were not allowed to fast forward or rewind videos inside the app for the longest time. TikTok recently added this feature; however, this new feature is not accessible for all users.

So, for those of you without this feature, we have found a way around it to let you fast forward and rewind your favorite TikTok videos; download them and that too without watermark on your iPhone or Android. Here's how.

**Step 1:** Open the TikTok app, and select the video that you wish to download for fast-forwarding or rewinding.

**Step 2:** Share this video page by clicking on the arrow icon located at the bottom-right of the page. If the publisher has enabled the download feature, you'll be able to save the video to your gallery.

In addition, you can simply fast forward and rewind video recordings on a computer with relative ease. To learn more, just follow these easy steps:

**Step 1:** Log in to your TikTok account by going to the TikTok website on your PC.

**Step 2:** Once you're on the home page, click on any video that you may wish to view.

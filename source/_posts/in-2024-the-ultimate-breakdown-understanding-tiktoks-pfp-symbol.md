Some of the most popular Italian food TikTok include the following:

### ● Lasagna

Lasagna is an Italian-style baked pasta dish made with layers of meat sauce, cheese, vegetables, and sometimes pasta sheets between them. It is usually served hot and usually with grated Parmesan cheese on top or sprinkled over the top of each layer.

### ● Pizza

We all have eaten pizza, but no one loves it more than an Italian. Pizza is baked in the oven and is topped with tomato sauce and cheese. However, toppings can range from meats to vegetables. Recipes of this Italian food on TikTok can be found in a huge number.

### ● Pasta

Pasta is an ever-green Italian dish and is quite popular on TikTok, with many people sharing their recipes. Typically, pasta is made from an unleavened dough of durum wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or various shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. It can also be made with flour from other cereals or grains. Pasta may be divided into two broad categories, dried (pasta secca) and fresh (pasta fresca).

### ● Tiramisu

Tiramisu is a layered Italian dessert cake that originated in the region of Veneto and was popularized in the 1960s. It consists of ladyfingers dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of eggs, sugar, and mascarpone cheese, flavored with cocoa.

### ● Risotto

Risotto is a northern Italian rice dish cooked with broth until it reaches a creamy consistency. The broth can be derived from meat, fish, or vegetables. Many types of risotto contain butter, onion, white wine, and parmesan cheese. It is one of the most common ways of cooking rice in Italy. Risotto in Italy is normally a primo (first course), served on its own before the main course.

## Japanese Food on TikTok

Japanese food is having a moment all over TikTok. The app's viral power has turned dishes like donburi (rice bowls), okonomiyaki (savory pancakes), and ramen noodles into must-try Japanese cuisines for home cooks worldwide.

The appeal of the Japanese food trend on TikTok is twofold. Firstly, it offers a way to explore different flavors and textures that may not be totally familiar. Secondly, when it comes to cooking Japanese food at home, many of the videos offer an important shortcut: they help you find easy alternatives to ingredients that are hard to come by.

Som popular Japanese food TikTok include:

### ● Sushi

Sushi is perhaps the most popular Japanese dish outside of Japan. It consists of cooked vinegared rice combined with other ingredients, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes tropical fruits. It’s mostly served with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce.

Sushi comes in many types, which include nigiri-zushi (oval-shaped rice topped with a slice of raw fish or seafood). Gunkan-maki is another type of sushi that is seaweed filled with rice and fish roe or other ingredients such as sea urchin roe or oysters.

### ● Hiyashi Chuka

Hiyashi chuka is a cold version of ramen, served with a mix of thinly sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, ham, and eggs. It's normally served during the summer months only.

### ● Shabu Shabu

Shabu shabu is a hot pot dish in which very thinly sliced beef and vegetables are cooked in water or broth and eaten with a dipping sauce. At the table, diners dip their meat and vegetables into the broth to cook them before eating.

### ● Kaiseki

Kaiseki meal is a multi-course meal that combines traditional Japanese aesthetics with seasonal ingredients. The dishes are usually smaller and more intricate than other dishes, making kaiseki one of the most beautiful cuisines in the world.

### ● Yakitori

Yakitori refers to chicken grilled on a skewer and seasoned with salt or tare sauce (a mix of soy sauce, sake, mirin, and sugar). They can be made from all different parts of the chicken, including breast, thigh, skin and cartilage among other things.

## TikTok African Food

![“TikTok African Food](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/popular-food-recipes-5.png)

The continent of Africa is so big that it's hard to generalize about its cuisine, or even to group its cuisines into categories. Even within individual countries or regions, you will find an astonishing variety of foods and flavors.

But there are some common themes that run through most African cuisines:

A preference for starchy staples – such as rice, yams, millet, sorghum, and maize (corn) – paired with sauces made from local ingredients such as tomatoes, leafy greens, peppers, and beans.

### ● Jollof rice

Nigerian jollof rice is one of the country's most popular dishes, and it's become a staple on TikTok. Jollof rice is a rice dish made with tomatoes, green peppers, onion, and spices like ginger, garlic, paprika, and black pepper.

It can be served as a side dish or as a meal with additional ingredients. Some users have added sausages and fried plantains to their jollof rice before serving.

### ● Suya

It’s another popular African food called TikTok. Suya is a snack that can be found all over Nigeria and West Africa. It consists of skewers of meat covered in peanut butter and spices like ginger powder, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, salt, vegetable oil, and bouillon cubes. The meat can be made from any cut of beef or chicken but traditionally uses beef steak or chicken thigh filet.

### ● Fufu

Fufu is a soft white dough made from cassava or yams flour (also known as cassava flour). It may also be made from plantain or cocoyam. Fufu is normally eaten with stews and soups like Peanut Soup in Ghana, Egusi Soup in Nigeria, etc.

### ● Braai

Braai comes from South Africa's BBQ tradition and is an important part of social gatherings in South Africa. There are several kinds of meat cooked on a grill such as steak, chicken, pork chops, sausages, etc.

## Conclusion

Eating a tasty meal is one way to relieve stress and refresh yourself. If you need some inspiration for your next cuisine from another country, you will find this collection of popular foods on TikTok very helpful.

Becoming a celebrity on social networking platforms is a daunting process. It is not easy to get millions of followers. The trend started with YouTube and has now spread on several social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok.

TikTok app has conquered globally in the past recent years through video sharing. Users spend hours editing their videos to get maximum likes and shares from their followers. But they still face fierce competition and do everything to improve the content quality of videos on TikTok. This is where video editors come into play. In this article, we will show you how to choose the best editor for Mac users to edit their TikTok video.

* Section1\. [Mac or Desktop Video Editors vs. Mobile Video Editors for TikTok](#s1)
* Section2\. [TikTok Video Editors That Can Make Stunning Videos on Mac](#s2)

## Section 1. Mac or Desktop Video Editors vs. Mobile Video Editors for TikTok

There are several video editors that TikTokers use to attract millions of viewers such as TikTok’s built-in video editor, mobile app editors, and online editors for Mac. However, editing on mobile phones or using built-in editors have their own limitations, therefore editing TikTok videos on desktop or Mac is way better.

Plus, you will get to know about overall comments, shares, or likes in that period.

Well, the list does not end here.

### 2. Followers section

To make this section work, you must have at least 100 followers. Then, it will show viewers’ demographic-related information such as timings, when users remain least/most active, followers from top 5 countries, growth trend, top videos, top sounds listened to, etc.

### 3. Content Section

This area gives any particular post/video/content in terms of comments, shares, or likes. Also, you will get to know about traffic source, average viewers, user location. It is to note that such information remains available for seven days only.

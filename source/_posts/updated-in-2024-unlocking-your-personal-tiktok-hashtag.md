**1\. Da Vicky**

In September, a set of Hungarian-Canadian twins were busy watching a movie. As expected, they responded in unison to a proverb about the one who painted the Mona Lisa that popped up on the screen. Instead of saying Da Vinci, the guys yelled loudly, "Da Vicky?" The video went viral, with the views skyrocketing to 2.4 million on TikTok alone.

**2\. It’s corona time**

The video has been viewed for a long time but became more prevalent towards the end of 2019 and 2021\. The beginning of the video seems boring but has a captivating ending. A character is punching himself, which adds humor to the video. Three-hand signals are used as timers, making it more interesting because it is impossible to have three hands.

**5\. Point–of–views**

These are videos that target the audience to be the main character. The producers of the video give their opinions from a personal perspective. They mainly encourage, earn and teach new behavior in people. That allows TikTok to grow as the characters in the videos also rise to prominence. Usually, they stress various issues in life like relationships, education, marriage, entertainment, and any other niche that requires people's opinions.

**1\. How to include filters/Overlays**

Wondershare Filmora has three ways of including filters in your videos.

Open Wondershare Filmora and go to the Effects tab, where you will choose your desired filter and include it in your project.

The second way is by hovering your mouse over the filter you want. You will see a “+” sign and click on it as the filter becomes automatically applied.

![effects wondersharefilmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filters-filmora-win.jpg)

**2\. How to remove filters**

You can use one of these ways to remove filters.

Select the filter within the timeline section and press the delete key on your keyboard.

Alternatively, you can right-click on the desired filter and select “delete” from the menu that appears.

**3\. How to locate filters/overlays**

Filters sorted into different categories like Bokeh, Faux Film, etc., makes it easy to locate them based on the category you want. Head to the effects menu, where you will find types to select.

By default, the length of each filter applied is 5 seconds. However, you can drag the applied effect in the timeline section to increase or reduce the duration.

Changing the alpha opacity of the TikTok anime filter

Alpha opacity determines the transparency of the video, and it has a range of 0 to 100\. Usually, a lower value means that your video is too transparent. Double click on the filter to alter its transparency, then confirm from the preview window. Chang it until you find a better video opacity.

**5\. How to use your favorite filters?**

In the effects menu, right-click on the filter effect and select "**Add to Favorite**" from the menu that appears. Once you finish, go to your favorite section, where you will quickly locate it.

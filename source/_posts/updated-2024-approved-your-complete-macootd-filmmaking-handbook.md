## How To Refresh & Revitalize Your TikTok Persona

Do you want to have a clear understanding of the TikTok instructions? Most importantly, want to know how to use it for viral growth to your advantage, which is a big concern in itself? If you intend on understanding how this can be possible, keep reading.

We will show how it can be possible in this blog post.

The **TikTok profile** may pose a significant challenge to some as usually, it is a complex and mysterious process in some way. Despite this being the case, TikTok has revealed exactly how it works!

In this blog post, everything we know about the TikTok profile's related FAQs and how you can start using it to your advantage will get discussed.

#### In this article

01 [Does TikTok Tell You Who Viewed Your Profile?](#part1)

02 [How to View Someone's TikTok Profile without them Knowing?](#part2)

03 [How to Change Profile Picture on TikTok](#part3)

04 [How to Edit TikTok Profile on PC (Include already uploaded TikTok)?](#part4)

05 [How to Optimize TikTok Profile in 2022?](#part5)

## Part 1: Does TikTok Tell You Who Viewed Your Profile?

The answer is NO. TikTok lacks a feature that allows users to see which accounts have viewed their videos. It means that while you may not see who is viewing your videos, your viewing habits are also left anonymous. Thus, you wouldn't be able to access the TikTok profile view.

TikTok only indicates how many people viewed the post instead of showing who has viewed your videos profile.

TikTok users can see who comments on their videos as well as who creates "duets" or "stitches" (essentially video edits) of their content using the **Activity** tab on the app.

## Part 2: How to View Someone's TikTok Profile without them Knowing?

To view someone's profile without them knowing, you need to upgrade to the latest updated TikTok app. TikTok will only indicate the number of viewers but no further information on who those viewers are.

It means you are already viewing others' TikTok profiles without them knowing.

## Part 3: How to Change Profile Picture on TikTok

You've got only two ways to represent yourself on TikTok with your profile picture and videos. Of course, the profile picture you put shows up on the profile page and every video posted.

Actively write comments. Whenever users visit your profile and see you write regularly, they are most likely to revert to your account or profile.

**Tip 4: Your profile must be complete**

In my view, TikTok profile competition is a very crucial tip as it keeps your profile up-to-date. Leaving a positive impression on users is vital, making it possible. Similarly, whoever lands on your profile will feel the appropriateness of the content. Presenting your profile to users so that it looks attractive and professional is critical nowadays.

**Tip 5: Create original videos**

If you are an active TikToker, you must be aware of the importance of content originality. It is highly advisable to be serious about posting authentic video content. To be outstanding, avoid any piracy and make original videos only.

**Tip 6: Linking TikTok account to other media platforms too like Facebook**

Linking other social media platforms like Facebook to your TikTok account is highly recommended. As a result, whoever visits your Facebook page and clicks on the TikTok link present, will reach your TikTok account, thereby indirectly boosting your account and answering to getting more views on TikTok.

**Tip 7: Use Powerful Video Editing Tool**

You should present your story in an exciting way, such as modifying the video, adding effects, and using many more exciting ways to create and add products to your video.

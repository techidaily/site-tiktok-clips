## Epic TikTok Dishes You Must Try

TikTok is one of the top video creating and sharing apps that lets you create your own short videos and share them with your followers. Most of the TikTok users are youngsters who make incredible videos while dancing, lip-syncing, cooking or singing, etc.

However, nothing can live up to the hype of the cooking TikTok videos that get viral from time to time. While Instagram is a more visual app for sharing pictures of beautifully put together plates of food, the recipes are not worth the effort.

Tiktok on the other hand delivers delicious recipes that can be made by anyone from a beginner to a professional. The food is not just visually appealing but is good enough to serve your guests.

## Top 10 Viral TikTok Food Recipes You Should Know

The TikTok viral food recipes and hacks have taken the world by the storm, especially since everyone has turned a home chef since the pandemic. There is a myriad of recipes floating on the internet, but not all of them are worthy of your time.

But, the other half have not just pleasantly surprised us but have also made way to our kitchens and our staple diet. Starting off on TikTok, these recipes gained popularity and then were introduced to Instagram and Youtube. So, if you still haven’t seen any one of these recipes, you can follow the link to the recipe video and recreate recipes. So, without wasting any more time, let us see the top 10 viral TikTok recipes:

### 1\. [Dalgona Coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SjCEOWd3PU)

Dalgona Coffee is not such a new phenomenon. It originated in the 1960s, but it was only recently that this fantastic coffee recipe got viral on TikTok. Dalgona Coffee is a mixture of water, sugar, and coffee that is whipped until the ground coffee turns caramel. The whipped coffee is then topped with iced milk, and it is ready to drink.

As 2020 began and the pandemic isolated us all in our homes, it was cooking we all turned to. Dalgona coffee is one of the top trends of that period. It all began when Korean actor Jung Il-woo shared his top-secret recipe in a program called “Stars’ Top Recipe at Fun-Staurant.” After that, many TikTokers started recreating their own version of the recipe until it became a trend.

### 2\. [Accordion Potatoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQWaLrEbiI0)

Whether it's french fries or hash browns, crispy fried potatoes have a class of their own. Perhaps that is why accordion potatoes became such a big trend on TikTok. Another reason for their popularity was that they could be excellent midnight or mid-morning snack that could be prepared in quick few steps.

Accordion potatoes can be used to elevate your potato side dish, and you can munch on them any time you want. While TikTok food influencers all made their own versions of the accordion potato, the fun part about this recipe is that you can easily alter it to your taste. Garnish it with salt, spices, garlic, or mayo; there are just too many versions to count.

The recipe is very easy, and even the dicing is not that difficult with numerous hacks available. Once diced, dip it into flour, fry it, and enjoy!

### 3\. [Quesadilla from a Tortilla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlARzxb-Jh0)

If you are a big foodie just like us, then you probably have seen a tortilla turned into quesadilla videos. This recipe has been circulating all over the internet, with everyone trying their own luck and getting amazed.

The Quesadilla from a tortilla was first discovered when a TikTok user [crystalscookingfun](https://www.tiktok.com/@crystalscookingfun?lang=en) posted a video of a round tortilla. She cut a single slit from the radius till the edge. Then she added a different ingredient in each of the quadrants and folded the tortilla in the shape of a quarter. She then placed it in a panini press, and Voila!

This recipe became a hit, and everyone began creating quesadillas with different ingredients. There were sweet ones and savory ones, including breakfast wraps, dessert wraps, and so much more.

### 4\. [Spicy Vodka Pasta by Gigi Hadid](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qQzSBgmQCzc)

The delicious and mouth-watering food Gigi Hadid cooked was something good that came out of the COVID-19 lockdown. Sharing all the recipes with her followers, all of us were no less than entertained. One of these was the highly talked about spicy vodka pasta.

While it is almost every day a new pasta dish or a pasta hack comes out, it is tough to properly cook a good pasta dish that is infused with flavors.

This quick recipe only required a few ingredients. Supermodel Gigi Hadid added some butter, parmesan cheese, shallots, heavy cream, and vodka to create this beauty. The pasta is well worth its hype. However, if you like your flavors a little differently, then you can easily create your own version of this spicy pasta sauce.

### 5\. [Pesto Eggs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQWaLrEbiI0)

One thing is for sure; once you try pesto eggs, it will be hard for you to go back to the simple fried eggs. Pesto eggs are such a flavorful upgrade from regular eggs and an easy hack that cooks in no time. Apparently, even Hollywood actor Chris Evans is also a big fan of the pesto eggs.

To create pesto eggs, all you need to do is cook two tablespoons of pesto in a pan and then add two eggs to it. Let your eggs cook and flip them over to cook from the other side. Once cooked, you can eat your eggs as it is or serve them with toast.

You can also create your own pesto eggs by adding in some chili flakes and spices or avocados.

### 6\. [Two Ingredient Chocolate Souffle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI4lwiuD2Bo)

TikTok has most certainly blessed us with some delectable desserts, but none of them can match up to the Chocolate souffle. This is no simple chocolate souffle. What makes this special is that it only requires two ingredients! All you need is a few eggs and a Nutella jar, and you can make your souffle anytime, anywhere.

Just separate egg whites from the yolks and then mix the yolks in the Nutella spread. Beat the egg whites until they are fluffy, and add them to the mixture. Then bake your souffle and serve it.

This is the perfect dessert for anyone who does not regularly indulge in cooking or is unfamiliar with cooking any other french delicacies. You can serve this to your guests or enjoy it yourself with a mug of coffee.

Elevate your steak dinner or barbeque part with some delicious corn ribs. You can not only serve it as a side dish, but you can also serve it as a main course. If you are looking for a meat-free meal, we highly recommend trying corn ribs.

Corn ribs are very simple to make. You take a corn ear and vertically slice it into four long ribs. Make sure you are using the corn rib after you have cleaned all the silk and dirt from it. Next, you can brush some spices mixed it oil over it to add some flavor to the corn. You can add herbs, chili flakes, or honey glaze. Now the last step is cooking the corn. You may grill it, bake it or air-fry it. You can then top it off with some cilantro or cotija cheese.

To serve your ribs, you can make a delicious dip using mayonnaise, chipotle sauce, or simply enjoy it with ketchup.

While Tiktok has introduced us to many new recipes, revamping and creating something new from old recipes has its own charm. One of these wholly redone recipes is the Pancake cereal introduced by The Naughty Fork. By combining two of our breakfast favorites, they brought us something magical.

The pancake cereal consists of bite-sized pancakes that are topped with maple syrup. All you need to do is make your pancake mixture and use a teaspoon to make bite-sized pancakes. You can pour the tiny pancakes into a bowl and enjoy them with your spoon rather than slicing them and getting your face dirty.

You can also upgrade this simple recipe by adding some fruits to your bowl, whipped cream, hazelnut spread, and create your delicious pancake cereal bowl. You can eat it as breakfast or a simple mid-day snack.

If you are a big foodie just like us, then you probably have seen a tortilla turned into quesadilla videos. This recipe has been circulating all over the internet, with everyone trying their own luck and getting amazed.

The Quesadilla from a tortilla was first discovered when a TikTok user [crystalscookingfun](https://www.tiktok.com/@crystalscookingfun?lang=en) posted a video of a round tortilla. She cut a single slit from the radius till the edge. Then she added a different ingredient in each of the quadrants and folded the tortilla in the shape of a quarter. She then placed it in a panini press, and Voila!

This recipe became a hit, and everyone began creating quesadillas with different ingredients. There were sweet ones and savory ones, including breakfast wraps, dessert wraps, and so much more.

### 4\. [Spicy Vodka Pasta by Gigi Hadid](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qQzSBgmQCzc)

The delicious and mouth-watering food Gigi Hadid cooked was something good that came out of the COVID-19 lockdown. Sharing all the recipes with her followers, all of us were no less than entertained. One of these was the highly talked about spicy vodka pasta.

While it is almost every day a new pasta dish or a pasta hack comes out, it is tough to properly cook a good pasta dish that is infused with flavors.

This quick recipe only required a few ingredients. Supermodel Gigi Hadid added some butter, parmesan cheese, shallots, heavy cream, and vodka to create this beauty. The pasta is well worth its hype. However, if you like your flavors a little differently, then you can easily create your own version of this spicy pasta sauce.

One thing is for sure; once you try pesto eggs, it will be hard for you to go back to the simple fried eggs. Pesto eggs are such a flavorful upgrade from regular eggs and an easy hack that cooks in no time. Apparently, even Hollywood actor Chris Evans is also a big fan of the pesto eggs.

To create pesto eggs, all you need to do is cook two tablespoons of pesto in a pan and then add two eggs to it. Let your eggs cook and flip them over to cook from the other side. Once cooked, you can eat your eggs as it is or serve them with toast.

You can also create your own pesto eggs by adding in some chili flakes and spices or avocados.

What makes this special is that it only requires two ingredients! All you need is a few eggs and a Nutella jar, and you can make your souffle anytime, anywhere.

Just separate egg whites from the yolks and then mix the yolks in the Nutella spread. Beat the egg whites until they are fluffy, and add them to the mixture. Then bake your souffle and serve it.

This is the perfect dessert for anyone who does not regularly indulge in cooking or is unfamiliar with cooking any other french delicacies. You can serve this to your guests or enjoy it yourself with a mug of coffee.

Elevate your steak dinner or barbeque part with some delicious corn ribs. You can not only serve it as a side dish, but you can also serve it as a main course. If you are looking for a meat-free meal, we highly recommend trying corn ribs.

Corn ribs are very simple to make. You take a corn ear and vertically slice it into four long ribs. Make sure you are using the corn rib after you have cleaned all the silk and dirt from it. Next, you can brush some spices mixed it oil over it to add some flavor to the corn. You can add herbs, chili flakes, or honey glaze. Now the last step is cooking the corn. You may grill it, bake it or air-fry it. You can then top it off with some cilantro or cotija cheese.

To serve your ribs, you can make a delicious dip using mayonnaise, chipotle sauce, or simply enjoy it with ketchup.

The TikTok's share menu features the email option, that enables you to send a video to yourself or to a friend via email. Once you select the video you want to send you should simply click on the **Share icon**, select the email option from the menu and insert the email addresses into the **To and From** sections.

You can also send TikTok videos to yourself by inserting your own email address into both sections.

Go to your email account where you will be able to see the video you sent to yourself or to your friend. The **Download option** will be displayed next to the video, so just click on it in order to save the video to your phone.

## Method 4: Saving MP4 Video Files to a PC

![Saving TikTok Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/musically-videos-homepage.jpg)

The web-based version of the TikTok platform called [Musical.ly Videos](https://musicallyvideos.com/) enables its users to browse through thousands of videos from their computers.

However, the download option is not available, so in order to save MP4 video files to a PC computer, you must first install the [5KPlayer](https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/) that lets you download videos from all video sharing platforms.

![Saving TikTok Video using 5kplayer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5kplayer-download-video.jpg)

You can download a video from the Muscial.ly video platform in just two simple steps. You first have to find the video you'd like to save to your computer and open its **preview page**.

Afterwards, you should just **copy the video's URL** and paste it into the 5KPlayer. You can do this by clicking on the **Paste URL & Analyze button** in the 5KPlayer.

Once the thumbnail of the video is displayed you can just click on the **Download button** to save the MP4 video file to the desired location on your hard drive.

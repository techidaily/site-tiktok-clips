TikTok Downloader is the same as the other video downloaders but it has something different as it’s a chrome extension that would only work if you have chrome installed on your PC. The best part of this extension is that it would show you the option of downloading all the videos at once if you are browsing the TikTok dashboard or profile of any video makers on TikTok. Though there are certain limitations on this tool if you are using a PC to watch and download TikTok videos then this extension is your best friend, in no time you can tons of tik videos if you have high-speed internet.

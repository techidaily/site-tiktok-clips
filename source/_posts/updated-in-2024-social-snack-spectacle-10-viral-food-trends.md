TikTok recently introduced a fantastic feature to customize or alter your video’s background without even looking for the green screen filter on your own. The “Green Screen Duet Feature.” This feature also lets users apply another person’s video as the background.

Green screens were once only available to those who had access to, well, a green screen. Now the case is different. You can utilize this "Green Screen" feature from the various applications now, allowing you to add a customizable background to your video, and TikTok is one of them. s Various content creators customize their background with effects, a still image, or even a video from their camera roll using the TikTok app.

Imagine scrolling down the TikTok app and finding an eye-catching customized background. Yes! You can utilize it to spice up your videos as well. We have already demonstrated how you can add a green screen effect in TikTok in your videos. But did you also know you can add green screen background from someone else's video to your TikTok? Even if you didn't, we have compiled a step-by-step guide that will give you a perfect depiction of how you can pull it off.

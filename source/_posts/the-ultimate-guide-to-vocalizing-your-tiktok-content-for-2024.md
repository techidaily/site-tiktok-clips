Ever since its arrival, TikTok has been a dominant force in the world of social media. A mix of lip sync videos, music, and micro-video content, TikTok is extremely popular with Gen Z. Over the years, TikTok has continued to enhance the user experience by adding new features, effects, and guidelines.

Text-to-speech is one of the newest features to be added to the popular platform and it provides an additional way to add something innovative to the video uploads. Announced in December 2020, **text to speech on TikTok** lets creators put their text over their videos and have a Siri-like voice read it out loud.

TikTok’s text-to-speech feature was added to make the platform accessible to more people by providing an easy way for text to be heard as well as read. Consequently, using this option in video creation is one way that content creators can ensure their videos appeal to a larger number of viewers, while also offering a more comprehensive experience in general.

Since its launch, the feature has been going viral. Many find the automated voice to be a selling point in itself and something that adds a different element to the content. Also, it is a great way to get a message across without actually speaking during the video. No matter the reason it is used, the fact that many are turning to text-to-speech makes it a great addition to TikTok.

Wondering how to get the text to speech on TikTok for your next video? Here’s a detailed insight into this new feature.

* [Part 4: How to Customize the Text-To-Speech Voice On TikTok?](#part4)

## Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?

In December 2020, TikTok began rolling out a new text-to-speech feature that automatically turns text into a voiceover as users watch videos that have the feature enabled. The popular social media platform included the new option as an accessibility feature for users with impaired vision, a growing trend for apps integrating voice technology.

Simply put, text to speech on TikTok allows video content creators to convert any piece of text they put on top of their video into a Siri-sounding voice. This means that whatever you type will be read out loud in a robotic tone, eliminating the need for you to narrate. It is a useful way to explain your videos to add context, describe what’s happening, or serve the purpose you see fit.

There are numerous reasons why you might decide to use this option. Firstly, it’s a great alternative for users who can’t or don’t want to use their own voice in videos. Perhaps you’re shy or just wish to keep an air of anonymity. Or, you might have a speech impediment, or communicate non-vocally or non-verbally. Either way, this feature offers a great alternative way to narrate to viewers.

Also, there are several benefits this feature provides to the audience. Some of your viewers may have poor eye-sight, might struggle to read, or are blind. Using text to speech on TikTok will help you make sure that they can still interact with your video.

Making your video more accessible means that you will get better engagement, which is a win-win situation for you. Lastly, many TikTokers use the text-to-speech option for comedic or dramatic effects.

## Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?

Recently, TikTok changed the voice on its text-to-speech feature to a new, more energetic, and upbeat voice. This is because of a lawsuit filed by professional voice actor Beverley Standing against ByteDance – the parent company of TikTok. Standing had sued ByteDance in mid-May for using her voice in the text-to-speech setting without her permission.

The lawsuit of the voice actor states that she was hired to work in 2018 for the state-backed Chinese Institute Of Acoustics research body to use in translations and that TikTok has used them without paying her and it has caused damage. She said she hadn’t authorized the use of her voice beyond the use for translations.

The lawsuit concerns the English-language voice used in North America. TikTok videos made prior to the change still feature the old tone. Although TikTok is yet to comment on the new voice or Standing’s lawsuit, the timing of the changes is very suggestive.

## Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?

Are you puzzled about how to get text to speech on TikTok? Check out the step-by-step guide below without any further ado!

#### Step 1: Update Your TikTok to The Latest Version

First things first, ensure your TikTok is updated to the latest version so that you have the TikTok text-to-speech function. Many people have the natural human tendency to push updates as far as technologically possible. But, if you are perplexed about how to do text to speech on TikTok, ensure you have the latest version of this social media app before anything else.

![latest version tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/latest-version-tiktok.jpg)

#### Step 2: Start Recording a Video

Take into account what you wish to say beforehand and have a rough idea of how quickly you want it to be read as the text to speech entry can be as long as your video. After you have the video recording you want to add the text over, press the checkmark on the lower right-hand corner of your app’s screen.

![start-record video tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/start-record-video-tiktok.jpeg)

#### Step 3: Enter Your Text

Next, tap the text icon at the bottom of your screen and type the text you’d like to be read aloud. Ensure you keep in mind the length. Once you have entered the text, tap ‘**Done**’ in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. This will insert a customizable text box over your video.

![enter text tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/enter-text-tiktok.png)

#### Step 4: Tap On the Text, Choose Text-To-Speech

When it comes to using text to speech on TikTok, this is another crucial step.Once you enter the text into the TikTok video, tap the Textbox and you will have three options: Text-to-Speech, Set Duration, and Edit. Select Text-to-Speech and the inbuilt text-to-speech AI of TikTok will read your text over the video.

![tap-text-to speech tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tap-text-to-speech-tiktok.png)

#### Step 5: Save the Video Locally

It is here that you will venture outside TikTok to change the text-to-speech voice. Once your video is ready in every other way, consider saving it locally on your device and not post it for everyone to see. Ensure the “**Save to Device**” option is active and you can post it privately.

![save-to device tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/save-to-device-tiktok.jpg)

#### Step 6: Download A Video Editor with Voice Modifiers

Next, you have to download a video editor – ideally for your smartphone – with voice modifiers. Adding ‘video’ into the search keywords alongside ‘Voice Modifier’ or ‘Voice Changer’ will bring up a list of options. Remember; many voice changers or free editors will either block the option to save edited videos onto the device behind a paywall or leave a watermark.

#### Step 7: Edit the Video and Resave

Once you have chosen your video editor, launch it and import your saved TikTok video. Here, you can edit the audio just like any other video, and voice modifiers can be applied if the video editing tool you choose has them. Apply different effects you’d like and resave your new and modified TikTok video to your device.

#### Step 8: Upload as A New Video to TikTok

Open the TikTok app and upload the new, edited TikTok as a singular video directly, without any further edits. You will get a TikTok video with a customized text-to-speech voice for all intents and purposes.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Ever since its arrival, TikTok has been a dominant force in the world of social media. A mix of lip sync videos, music, and micro-video content, TikTok is extremely popular with Gen Z. Over the years, TikTok has continued to enhance the user experience by adding new features, effects, and guidelines.

Text-to-speech is one of the newest features to be added to the popular platform and it provides an additional way to add something innovative to the video uploads. Announced in December 2020, **text to speech on TikTok** lets creators put their text over their videos and have a Siri-like voice read it out loud.

TikTok’s text-to-speech feature was added to make the platform accessible to more people by providing an easy way for text to be heard as well as read. Consequently, using this option in video creation is one way that content creators can ensure their videos appeal to a larger number of viewers, while also offering a more comprehensive experience in general.

Since its launch, the feature has been going viral. Many find the automated voice to be a selling point in itself and something that adds a different element to the content. Also, it is a great way to get a message across without actually speaking during the video. No matter the reason it is used, the fact that many are turning to text-to-speech makes it a great addition to TikTok.

Wondering how to get the text to speech on TikTok for your next video? Here’s a detailed insight into this new feature.

## Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?

In December 2020, TikTok began rolling out a new text-to-speech feature that automatically turns text into a voiceover as users watch videos that have the feature enabled. The popular social media platform included the new option as an accessibility feature for users with impaired vision, a growing trend for apps integrating voice technology.

Simply put, text to speech on TikTok allows video content creators to convert any piece of text they put on top of their video into a Siri-sounding voice. This means that whatever you type will be read out loud in a robotic tone, eliminating the need for you to narrate. It is a useful way to explain your videos to add context, describe what’s happening, or serve the purpose you see fit.

There are numerous reasons why you might decide to use this option. Firstly, it’s a great alternative for users who can’t or don’t want to use their own voice in videos. Perhaps you’re shy or just wish to keep an air of anonymity. Or, you might have a speech impediment, or communicate non-vocally or non-verbally. Either way, this feature offers a great alternative way to narrate to viewers.

Also, there are several benefits this feature provides to the audience. Some of your viewers may have poor eye-sight, might struggle to read, or are blind. Using text to speech on TikTok will help you make sure that they can still interact with your video.

Making your video more accessible means that you will get better engagement, which is a win-win situation for you. Lastly, many TikTokers use the text-to-speech option for comedic or dramatic effects.

## Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?

Recently, TikTok changed the voice on its text-to-speech feature to a new, more energetic, and upbeat voice. This is because of a lawsuit filed by professional voice actor Beverley Standing against ByteDance – the parent company of TikTok. Standing had sued ByteDance in mid-May for using her voice in the text-to-speech setting without her permission.

The lawsuit of the voice actor states that she was hired to work in 2018 for the state-backed Chinese Institute Of Acoustics research body to use in translations and that TikTok has used them without paying her and it has caused damage. She said she hadn’t authorized the use of her voice beyond the use for translations.

The lawsuit concerns the English-language voice used in North America. TikTok videos made prior to the change still feature the old tone. Although TikTok is yet to comment on the new voice or Standing’s lawsuit, the timing of the changes is very suggestive.

## Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?

Are you puzzled about how to get text to speech on TikTok? Check out the step-by-step guide below without any further ado!

#### Step 1: Update Your TikTok to The Latest Version

First things first, ensure your TikTok is updated to the latest version so that you have the TikTok text-to-speech function. Many people have the natural human tendency to push updates as far as technologically possible. But, if you are perplexed about how to do text to speech on TikTok, ensure you have the latest version of this social media app before anything else.

![latest version tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/latest-version-tiktok.jpg)

#### Step 2: Start Recording a Video

Take into account what you wish to say beforehand and have a rough idea of how quickly you want it to be read as the text to speech entry can be as long as your video. After you have the video recording you want to add the text over, press the checkmark on the lower right-hand corner of your app’s screen.

![start-record video tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/start-record-video-tiktok.jpeg)

#### Step 3: Enter Your Text

Next, tap the text icon at the bottom of your screen and type the text you’d like to be read aloud. Ensure you keep in mind the length. Once you have entered the text, tap ‘**Done**’ in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. This will insert a customizable text box over your video.

![enter text tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/enter-text-tiktok.png)

#### Step 4: Tap On the Text, Choose Text-To-Speech

When it comes to using text to speech on TikTok, this is another crucial step.Once you enter the text into the TikTok video, tap the Textbox and you will have three options: Text-to-Speech, Set Duration, and Edit. Select Text-to-Speech and the inbuilt text-to-speech AI of TikTok will read your text over the video.

![tap-text-to speech tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tap-text-to-speech-tiktok.png)

#### Step 5: Save the Video Locally

It is here that you will venture outside TikTok to change the text-to-speech voice. Once your video is ready in every other way, consider saving it locally on your device and not post it for everyone to see. Ensure the “**Save to Device**” option is active and you can post it privately.

![save-to device tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/save-to-device-tiktok.jpg)

#### Step 6: Download A Video Editor with Voice Modifiers

Next, you have to download a video editor – ideally for your smartphone – with voice modifiers. Adding ‘video’ into the search keywords alongside ‘Voice Modifier’ or ‘Voice Changer’ will bring up a list of options. Remember; many voice changers or free editors will either block the option to save edited videos onto the device behind a paywall or leave a watermark.

#### Step 7: Edit the Video and Resave

Once you have chosen your video editor, launch it and import your saved TikTok video. Here, you can edit the audio just like any other video, and voice modifiers can be applied if the video editing tool you choose has them. Apply different effects you’d like and resave your new and modified TikTok video to your device.

#### Step 8: Upload as A New Video to TikTok

Open the TikTok app and upload the new, edited TikTok as a singular video directly, without any further edits. You will get a TikTok video with a customized text-to-speech voice for all intents and purposes.

## Part 1: Why does TikTok Advertising Matter?

### 1\. The current generation dominates the entire platform

As the statement suggests, most TikTok users are teens and young adults. According to research, it is the largest population and has a considerable purchasing power of over $140 billion. Currently known as Generation Z, it also consists of the largest population in the United States and other countries in the world. These statistics imply that your business can grow when you invest in targeting this audience. Therefore, use TikTok Ads Manager to market your business here. As expected, you will collect more revenue from TikTok users.

### 2\. High engagement rate on TikTok

Surprisingly, TikTok has overtaken so many leading brands like Facebookregarding time spent by users. Over 70% of users in the United States and the UK spend more time on TikTok than Facebook. Advertising on TikTok always increases the engagement rate required for your business. Consequently, many companies have taken advantage of that and benefited more than they had on other platforms. Some startling facts?

Young adults' average time on Facebook is 58.5 minutes, while TikTok consumes 1 hour and 20 minutes of their time every day. Do you know what that means? More people will encounter your products and services on TikTok than on any social media platform. The more significant number of viewers leads to a larger market to get more clients.

### 3\. Advertising on TikTok gets your video to be viewed by many

A larger population retains more information obtained from videos than written information. About 93% of brands have gained many customers by using social media. Advertising your products on social media platforms allows you to reach a wider audience than other ways of communication. Most of the people are members of various social media groups. That translates to reaching a wider audience by using a single ad.

### 4\. The numerous ad formats for TikTok allow more significant engagements

TikTok comes with many TikTok advertising formats that will make you reach a wider audience. Whether they are making videos, watching the "For You" feeds, or whatever they are doing on TikTok, they will still come across your ads.

We have covered these types of advert formats below, so keep reading. If you have never used videos in marketing, give it a try and see miracles happen. Any marketing campaign that utilizes video is always powerful compared to text.

### 5.TikTok ads convey your products and services to an international audience

TikTok is currently available in 170 countries, and its expansion does not seem to slow down very soon. Moreover, it has many language subtitles amounting to 70\. Since most of these languages are international, there's no reason why you should be hesitating to access a global market. It doesn't matter whether your business is still getting on its feet. You will quickly get clients by serving them online. Slowly you will find your way out and end up surpassing the branded "marketing experts."

## Part 2: What are Types of TikTok Ads?

We have been stressing about types of TikTok ads, and now they are. There are five TikTok ads examples that you can use to embrace your digital marketing skills.

**1\. In-Feed Ads**

![tiktok in feed ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-in-feed-ads.jpg)

These are ads that will get displayed in the recommended videos of TikTok users. Regardless of their browsing history, they will come across these ads and get anxious about the services they are making efforts to market. The better part is that TikTokers can share your ads and help you to use more negligible amounts of the hard-earned money you spend in purchasing the ads. Viewers can also comment and like your ads. Take advantage of converting those who comment and subscribe to long-term clients—usually, blending this with other marketing tactics makes it even better!

A takeaway tip- include some inspiring music to convince your customers.

**2\. Brand Takeover ads**

These pop-up ads appear on the screen once the user opens the TikTok app. Usually, the ad will stay on the screen for a short time before turning into a feeds ad. Your ad will still be visible in the "For You" section. It can appear as a video or image with hyperlinks to direct the client's interest to your webpage. It is not just about helping TikTok get backlinks but primarily promoting your business. That's not just interesting. It's because your work is made much easier by waiting for the client to click on the ad. Ensure that your ad is impressive enough to have a higher click-through rate. Remember that your click-through rate will determine the number of sales you get.

**3\. Top View ads**

![tiktok top view ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-top-view-ads.jpg)

These cover the first post in the "**Feeds**" section for a short while. Ground shuttering sounds always accompany them to capture the audience's attention through the TikTok marketing campaigns. As usual, everyone will always pay attention to what the sound is all about. Right? At that moment, any interested viewers will click the link in the ad, which will direct them to your landing page. That's where they will find all that they need and might consider trying out what you offer.

**4\. Branded hashtags ads**

![tiktok hashtags ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-hastags-ads.jpg)

Branded hashtags adverts are the most common on TikTok. They will mainly involve asking someone to record a video of a specific action. For instance, they will include uploading a video of something like doing some gymnastics, performing a dance, or something of the sort. The video uploaded is always under specific hashtags.

This idea has been helpful for many content creators whereby clicking on one of the videos leads to the emergence of related videos under the same hashtag. It is a perfect way to build your brand and trust among the clients you deal with. Whenever a customer comes across a video from somebody who has used the same product, they will be automatically convinced.

Have you ever come across customer reviews on marketing brands like Amazon? That's the same way that this technique works. The only difference is that reviews are written, while branded hashtags have hyperlinks to lead you to a video.

**5\. Branded effects ads**

![tiktok effects ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-effects-ads.jpg)

Unlike branded hashtags adverts, branded effects ads come with unique animations, including applying some filters on the ad. They last for more than a week on TikTok before changing to break the monotony of those who see them. Like your products in the market, customers will always be happy to see your new and improved products. Therefore, you will maintain the content while filter effects are changed occasionally.

### 5\. Ralph Lauren

![ralph lauren](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-ads-ralph-lauren.jpg)

This was a TikTok ad created to market the clothing business of Ralph Lauren. Did it also use hashtags? Yes, but there was something extra. The company used a social media influencer, Diana Silvers, an actress. Usually, everyone would always want to listen to what celebrities are saying.

The fact that Diana was an actress made the company get recognized. Clients were allowed to make direct purchases just by using a few clicks—the number of customers received that month was tremendous.

Creating and running adverts on TikTok should not be difficult. The app has a straightforward way of doing it.

Pick from the available sections from the tab depending on your marketing preferences. You are at liberty to choose from traffic, app installs, and conversions.

Before you begin advertising, have some cash to purchase the ad for as little as $10 for a successful TikTok campaign. The amount you choose to pay depends on the format and duration of the ad. Presently, only short-duration ads are supported. But of course, we expect the period to increase with time. Use the Newsfeed section to get some captivating images for your ads. Also include some videos from your library, template, brilliant video, or upload a new one.

**Upload a new video**. Let the video that you select be original. It should be new so that people find it fascinating. No one would enjoy watching something that has been around for long.

**Add text to your videos**. The text communicates more information than just video. A call-to-action will do better because readers will get prompted to take immediate action- a TikTok campaign idea that has worked for the leading brands that boast of their many clients.

## Part 1: Why does TikTok Advertising Matter?

### 1\. The current generation dominates the entire platform

As the statement suggests, most TikTok users are teens and young adults. According to research, it is the largest population and has a considerable purchasing power of over $140 billion. Currently known as Generation Z, it also consists of the largest population in the United States and other countries in the world. These statistics imply that your business can grow when you invest in targeting this audience. Therefore, use TikTok Ads Manager to market your business here. As expected, you will collect more revenue from TikTok users.

### 2\. High engagement rate on TikTok

Surprisingly, TikTok has overtaken so many leading brands like Facebookregarding time spent by users. Over 70% of users in the United States and the UK spend more time on TikTok than Facebook. Advertising on TikTok always increases the engagement rate required for your business. Consequently, many companies have taken advantage of that and benefited more than they had on other platforms. Some startling facts?

Young adults' average time on Facebook is 58.5 minutes, while TikTok consumes 1 hour and 20 minutes of their time every day. Do you know what that means? More people will encounter your products and services on TikTok than on any social media platform. The more significant number of viewers leads to a larger market to get more clients.

### 3\. Advertising on TikTok gets your video to be viewed by many

A larger population retains more information obtained from videos than written information. About 93% of brands have gained many customers by using social media. Advertising your products on social media platforms allows you to reach a wider audience than other ways of communication. Most of the people are members of various social media groups. That translates to reaching a wider audience by using a single ad.

### 4\. The numerous ad formats for TikTok allow more significant engagements

TikTok comes with many TikTok advertising formats that will make you reach a wider audience. Whether they are making videos, watching the "For You" feeds, or whatever they are doing on TikTok, they will still come across your ads.

We have covered these types of advert formats below, so keep reading. If you have never used videos in marketing, give it a try and see miracles happen. Any marketing campaign that utilizes video is always powerful compared to text.

### 5.TikTok ads convey your products and services to an international audience

TikTok is currently available in 170 countries, and its expansion does not seem to slow down very soon. Moreover, it has many language subtitles amounting to 70\. Since most of these languages are international, there's no reason why you should be hesitating to access a global market. It doesn't matter whether your business is still getting on its feet. You will quickly get clients by serving them online. Slowly you will find your way out and end up surpassing the branded "marketing experts."

## Part 2: What are Types of TikTok Ads?

We have been stressing about types of TikTok ads, and now they are. There are five TikTok ads examples that you can use to embrace your digital marketing skills.

**1\. In-Feed Ads**

![tiktok in feed ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-in-feed-ads.jpg)

These are ads that will get displayed in the recommended videos of TikTok users. Regardless of their browsing history, they will come across these ads and get anxious about the services they are making efforts to market. The better part is that TikTokers can share your ads and help you to use more negligible amounts of the hard-earned money you spend in purchasing the ads. Viewers can also comment and like your ads. Take advantage of converting those who comment and subscribe to long-term clients—usually, blending this with other marketing tactics makes it even better!

A takeaway tip- include some inspiring music to convince your customers.

**2\. Brand Takeover ads**

These pop-up ads appear on the screen once the user opens the TikTok app. Usually, the ad will stay on the screen for a short time before turning into a feeds ad. Your ad will still be visible in the "For You" section. It can appear as a video or image with hyperlinks to direct the client's interest to your webpage. It is not just about helping TikTok get backlinks but primarily promoting your business. That's not just interesting. It's because your work is made much easier by waiting for the client to click on the ad. Ensure that your ad is impressive enough to have a higher click-through rate. Remember that your click-through rate will determine the number of sales you get.

**3\. Top View ads**

![tiktok top view ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-top-view-ads.jpg)

These cover the first post in the "**Feeds**" section for a short while. Ground shuttering sounds always accompany them to capture the audience's attention through the TikTok marketing campaigns. As usual, everyone will always pay attention to what the sound is all about. Right? At that moment, any interested viewers will click the link in the ad, which will direct them to your landing page. That's where they will find all that they need and might consider trying out what you offer.

**4\. Branded hashtags ads**

![tiktok hashtags ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-hastags-ads.jpg)

Branded hashtags adverts are the most common on TikTok. They will mainly involve asking someone to record a video of a specific action. For instance, they will include uploading a video of something like doing some gymnastics, performing a dance, or something of the sort. The video uploaded is always under specific hashtags.

This idea has been helpful for many content creators whereby clicking on one of the videos leads to the emergence of related videos under the same hashtag. It is a perfect way to build your brand and trust among the clients you deal with. Whenever a customer comes across a video from somebody who has used the same product, they will be automatically convinced.

Have you ever come across customer reviews on marketing brands like Amazon? That's the same way that this technique works. The only difference is that reviews are written, while branded hashtags have hyperlinks to lead you to a video.

**5\. Branded effects ads**

![tiktok effects ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-effects-ads.jpg)

Unlike branded hashtags adverts, branded effects ads come with unique animations, including applying some filters on the ad. They last for more than a week on TikTok before changing to break the monotony of those who see them. Like your products in the market, customers will always be happy to see your new and improved products. Therefore, you will maintain the content while filter effects are changed occasionally.

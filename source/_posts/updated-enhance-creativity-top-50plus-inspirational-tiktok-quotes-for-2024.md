## Part 1: What Makes a Good TikTok Quote?

There are several quotes available over the internet but not all of them can be used as quotes for your videos.

A good TikTok quote can stop the scroller on track and make them spend more time watching your video. A good quiet is one that is powerful enough to encourage views and comments. It should be able to create a stronger relationship with the audience.

A strong caption can shape your personality. It elevates your success on TikTok. A good caption can improve your bottom line. But your TikTok quote depends on what you want to portray.

Every rising pop star needs music videos, but using professional video editing software may be too time-consuming if you want to quickly create a clone video you can share with your fans on TikTok.

Multiplying yourself in a video is a cool way of making sure that your video is going to get the kind of attention it deserves. The process of [cloning yourself in a video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a simple one, but there are certain rules you have to follow while recording the footage that will help you avoid overlapping the figures you're cloning. Here's how you can make your first **clone yourself video on TikTok**.

![Clone Yourself on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clone-yourself-on-tiktok.jpg)

## Selecting the Song for your Clone Video

Before you start shooting the video you first need to select the song on [TikTok](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id835599320?mt=8)you're going to use in the video. Once you've found the perfect track simply record it and save it as a video to your camera roll. You can then import the video clip that contains the song into the [Video Star](http://videostarapp.com/) app.

Here are [10 Popular TikTok Songs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for you.

## Using the Video Star App to Clone Yourself

#### 1\. Download Video Star App

Choosing a location, mounting your iPhone on a tripod, or picking the positions for each of your clones are all important steps you'll need to take before you actually start recording. There are several apps that enable you to create clone videos easily, but in this article, we are going to show you how you can clone yourself with Video Star. The app can be downloaded from the App Store for free, but additional in-app purchases are necessary if you want to have access to all the power packs Video Star offers. You don't have to record the video clips with this app since the iPhone's native camera app is powerful enough to enable you to record high-quality footage.

#### 2\. Edit Multiple Video Clips

After you record all the positions for your next clone video with the iPhone's native camera app, you should cut the video clips and keep only the parts where you are perfectly positioned, so your position in one clip doesn't overlap with other positions. During the video recording process try to create as much separation between two positions in order to avoid any chance of overlapping. One of the best ways to achieve this is to shoot at a location that is spacious enough so you can make enough separation between two positions. Keep in mind that the maximum number of clips you can combine in the Video Star app is limited to just three, so if you want to have more than three clones in the shot you first have to piece together three clips, save them as a single file and then add more clips to the cloned video you created.

#### 3\. Level up Your Videos with Video Star

Video Star also enables you to shoot your videos from the app, and you can adjust the Countdown before the app starts recording or the Recording Speed. Make sure to enter the lowest Recording Speed value possible, because that way you'll be recording like TikTok does on fast.

Tap the Record button, then select the Multiple options, and play the video that contains the song you previously selected. Once you reach the spot in the song where you want to introduce the clone simply tap Set, so the recording will stop at the designated point and you can move to another position. If at any point during recording you realize that your movements extend to your clone's location, you can simply tap on the hamburger icon and select the Delete Last option.

To preview the video, you just have to tap on the Scissors icon, and the recorded video will automatically start playing. The Record New Clip in the Scissors menu lets you start from the beginning in case you're not happy with the results or you can use this option to start recording the video with the second position of your clone.

When done, head back to the Scissors menu, and tap on the Multi-Layer Clip. This feature doesn't come with the free version of the app, and you must purchase it in order to create a clone video. This action will enable you to select the back and front clips. After selecting the clips, the Mask Front menu will appear on the screen, choose the Shape option and use the hamburger icon on the right side of the screen to change the video's shape to Rectangle. Drag the rectangle in the preview window so you can crop the first clip to match the demands of your video and press the Next icon to continue the video editing process.

Alternatively, you can use the Erase option to remove the unwanted parts of each video. You can find this option in the Mask Front or Mask Back menu, so just select it and use your finger to remove sections of the shot you don't want to use.

The Add Effect menu will pop up on the screen so you can add different effects to your first video clip, and then repeat the entire process for the back clip. Once you've edited the second clip tap on the Create button to complete the process of making a multilayer clip. Tap Done to save the clip to your camera roll, and upload it to TikTok.

### Conclusion

Cloning yourself in a video using the Video Star app is a simple process that can be mastered in a short period of time. The Video Star app lets you create as many clones of yourself as you want, so you just have to make sure that your video clips can be easily combined to feature two or more of your clones and have fun exploring the effects that can make your videos look even cooler. If you want to be a success on the TikTok platform, learning how to make clone videos is one of the best ways to do it, so choose your favorite songs and start producing clone yourself videos.

**Record Voiceover and Add it to Video**

We suggest you record the voiceover first in most cases so the sound will become pretty natural.

**Step 1: Connect Microphone to PC or laptop**

Connect the microphone to your laptop/PC when you're ready to begin. It's advisable to use some professional external microphones to capture high-quality sound.

**Step 2: Record voiceover**

Tap the **Wondershare Filmora** icon to launch this software. Then, select the New **Project** option in the beginning interface to create a new one.

Enter the **Record** tab and choose the "**Record a Voiceover”** option to arouse the **Record Audio** windows.

Or hit the **microphone** icon, and you only need 3 seconds of countdown to begin speaking.

Click the microphone icon again after you finish the above. Then, a new **Record** file option will be automatically present on the audio track.

**Step 3: Edit Recorded Voiceover to Video**

To edit the recorded voiceover, you can adjust audio settings, such as changing the Speed, Pitch, Volume, etc.

![edit voiceover filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-editing-panel.jpg)

You can cut and trim out unnecessary sound sections from the recorded voiceover or apply the fade effects to the voiceover for a smoother transition.

**Step 4: Sync Voiceover to Video**

Now, it’s time to synchronize the recorded voiceover to video to create a compelling video.

The Wondershare Filmora allows up to 100 audio tracks; you can also add some background music to the voiceover.

Then import and drag-n-drop the video content to the video track, drag and drop the soundtrack to the video's right-side position. Keep the voice and video track in the exact video duration if required.

**Here’s how to sync voiceover to video!**

Now, sync the recorded voiceover to Video to create a video. Since Filmora is compatible with 100 plus audio tracks, you can add different background music to the voiceover.

Then import and drag-n-drop the video content to the video track, drag and drop the soundtrack to the Video's right side position. You can keep the Video and audio track in the same video duration.

![sync voiceover filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sync-recorded-voiceover-to-video.jpg)

**Note**: If you've recorded the iPhone voiceover or other device already, you can import it in the Project Library if you wish to add it to the Video and then sync it to Video.

Here is the ultimate step-by-step guide about adding titles to videos after knowing **how to do a voiceover on TikTok**.

**Step 5: Export and save the new file**

Click the "**Export**" tab to export your new video file after you complete the project. You can either save the Video to different formats or directly share it on other social media platforms.

Additionally, you can even burn a DVD in minutes to watch it on TV.

**How to Record and Add Voice over File during Filmora's Video Editing Process**

If you've recorded the voice over on your iPhone or another device already, even via the Wondershare Filmora, and wish to add it to the Video, visit the steps mentioned below:

**1\. Upload the video to Filmora**

After logging in to Filmora’s main editing interface, click "Import" or drag-drop your video and voiceover file to the project library.

Filmora video editing software is compatible with a vast range of formats, so there will be no need to convert the files before import.

Drag and drop the files or video content to the Video Timeline when all the files get imported.

**2\. Record Voiceover in Video Editing**

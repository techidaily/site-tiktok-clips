Here's all you are required to know regarding grabbing the good TikTok usernames!

### 1. Cool Generator

As the name suggests, it's a pretty cool username generator that you can use by just putting the random idea. However, you also can select among a **boy** or a **girl** from the drop-down menu. Beneath these tabs, you have **an Idea** to describe your thoughts or brand identity in a few simple words or phrases.

For instance, we have entered **the Dance** keyword, and it offers a ton of ideas, including new ones.

### 3. Don't exceed the character limit

The character limit of the TikTok username is around 24 characters. It is one of the valuable factors you shouldn't violate while picking your name. You can save your characters and use them intelligently to showcase your audience or identity thoroughly. Extract the most crucial aspects of your brand and display those in your username.

### 4. Describe your brand’s intention

Extract the most crucial aspects of your brand and display those in your username. This point is especially applicable when you have a brand to showcase on TikTok. Here, it would help if you displayed the intention by juicing out everything essential in your branding strategies. We know that it's pretty tough to showcase all in a single username. Still, you can try by picking an all-in-one sort of username.

### 1. Cool Generator

As the name suggests, it's a pretty cool username generator that you can use by just putting the random idea. However, you also can select among a **boy** or a **girl** from the drop-down menu. Beneath these tabs, you have **an Idea** to describe your thoughts or brand identity in a few simple words or phrases.

For instance, we have entered **the Dance** keyword, and it offers a ton of ideas, including new ones.

One of the greatest advantages of using Adobe Rush is that it doesn’t require users to have advanced video editing skills. With the ease of this cross-platform app, it is easy to create short social media videos for platforms like TikTok.

Some of the key features of this editor include the application of color grading effects, adjustment of video's aspect ratio, and use of the app's motion graphics templates. Moreover, users can adjust the shadows, exposure, and vibrance in all the video clips that they import into a created project in Adobe Rush.

* Cross-platform availability
* Compatibility with Adobe’s professional video editing software products
* Ability to share videos directly to TikTok from Adobe Rush

Cons:

* The app is available globally
* Users can export only 3 videos in a month using the free app version

## Part 3: Why You Shouldn't Remove the Watermark from TikTok Videos?

People have divided opinions when it comes to keeping the watermark logo or getting rid of it entirely. Understandably, the TikTok emblem can be bothersome to specific users because it seems an "extra" item on the screen rather than a part of the content.

TikTok has finally created a PC website to let its customers use the app online, as it is simply accessible straight from the browser. The features of this online version are primarily the same as the mobile app version. However, you will need to adjust yourself to the Platforms PC interface, which may be a bit difficult at first, but you'll eventually wrap your head around it. The only downside is that some app features are blocked online, but it's an excellent starting point for Windows users.

Follow the simple steps below to know how to use TikTok online:

**Step 1:** Access TikTok online on PC by simply visiting **TikTok.com**, and then press the **Login** button on the top right corner to enter your TikTok account.

## Part 3: Why You Shouldn't Remove the Watermark from TikTok Videos?

People have divided opinions when it comes to keeping the watermark logo or getting rid of it entirely. Understandably, the TikTok emblem can be bothersome to specific users because it seems an "extra" item on the screen rather than a part of the content.

Yet, this does not imply that we support or urge its removal. If you're seeking to promote your content across many channels, you must retain the watermark since it allows the creator of the content to be correctly recognized.

## Part 4: FAQs About Downloading TikTok Video

**1\. Why Can't I Download Some TikTok Videos?**

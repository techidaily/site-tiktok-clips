We will look at some of the top TikTok filters that make your video stand out from the crowd.

### 1.TikTok's G6 filter

On TikTok, filters are identified by a single maker and number. While G6 is labeled a food-related filter, it's become increasingly popular due to its bright, colorful, and slightly retro feel.

![tiktok g6 filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-g6-filter.jpg)

### 2.TikTok's Anime Filter

When individuals uploaded their Snapchat videos to TikTok, the anime filter became quite popular. This filter transforms you into an animated character, but you'll need to download Snapchat first and get an account if you don't already have one.

![tiktok anime filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-anime-filter.jpeg)

### 3.TikTokâ€™s Invisible filter

Another outcome of viral videos is TikTok's Invisible filter. This one gives you the ability to become invisible, which is fantastic if you've ever wanted to try out that superpower.

![tiktok invisible filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-invisible-filter.jpg)

### 4.TikTok's Bling Effect

The Bling effect is another effect that is likely to appear on your For You page. This effect imitates the flash of a diamond being struck by the sun in different locations across the film.

![tiktok bling effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-bling-filter.jpg)

### 5.TikTok's Disney Effect

The Disney TikTok filter gives you a chance to experience what it's like to be a Disney princess or prince. This effect transforms your face into a Disney-inspired cartoon character.

This filter, like the anime filter, is available on Snapchat. So make sure you've downloaded that app first.

![tiktok disney effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-disney-filter.jpg)

### 6.TikTok Dog Face

The Dog Face filter is another amusing face to experiment on. You get dog ears, a nose, and even a tongue with this one. However, you must record another filter in Snapchat before publishing it to TikTok.

![tiktok dog face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-filter-dog-face.jpg)

### 7.TikTok's Inverted Filter

The Inverted filter is a little more divisive than the others. This filter flips any video you capture, and it's famous for using the front-facing camera because it's said to mimic how other people perceive you. So, what's the big deal about it? On the other hand, the inverted filter has enraged some users, who don't always appreciate their "true" reflection. However, the only way to see what all the fuss (or hysteria) is about is to give it a try.

![tiktok inverted filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-inverted-filter.jpg)

### 8.TikTok's Face Zoom effect

As the name suggests, the Face Zoom effect zooms-in on your face. Some people use it in group videos to see which face the filter lands on, while others use the same to compare how you look up close versus how you look from a distance.

![tiktok face zoom effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-face-zoom-effect.jpg)

### 9.TikTok's Face Morph

The Face Morph effect is another popular effect. This one lets you morph and transition between multiple images of someone else's face. The effect may be under TikTok's Templates area because it employs graphics rather than video.

### 2.TikTok's Anime Filter

When individuals uploaded their Snapchat videos to TikTok, the anime filter became quite popular. This filter transforms you into an animated character, but you'll need to download Snapchat first and get an account if you don't already have one.

![tiktok anime filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-anime-filter.jpeg)

### 3.TikTokâ€™s Invisible filter

Another outcome of viral videos is TikTok's Invisible filter. This one gives you the ability to become invisible, which is fantastic if you've ever wanted to try out that superpower.

![tiktok invisible filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-invisible-filter.jpg)

### 4.TikTok's Bling Effect

The Bling effect is another effect that is likely to appear on your For You page. This effect imitates the flash of a diamond being struck by the sun in different locations across the film.

### 5.TikTok's Disney Effect

The Disney TikTok filter gives you a chance to experience what it's like to be a Disney princess or prince. This effect transforms your face into a Disney-inspired cartoon character.

### 6.TikTok Dog Face

The Dog Face filter is another amusing face to experiment on. You get dog ears, a nose, and even a tongue with this one. However, you must record another filter in Snapchat before publishing it to TikTok.

![tiktok dog face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-filter-dog-face.jpg)

### 7.TikTok's Inverted Filter

The Inverted filter is a little more divisive than the others. This filter flips any video you capture, and it's famous for using the front-facing camera because it's said to mimic how other people perceive you. So, what's the big deal about it? On the other hand, the inverted filter has enraged some users, who don't always appreciate their "true" reflection. However, the only way to see what all the fuss (or hysteria) is about is to give it a try.

![tiktok inverted filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-inverted-filter.jpg)

### 8.TikTok's Face Zoom effect

As the name suggests, the Face Zoom effect zooms-in on your face. Some people use it in group videos to see which face the filter lands on, while others use the same to compare how you look up close versus how you look from a distance.

![tiktok face zoom effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-face-zoom-effect.jpg)

### 9.TikTok's Face Morph

The Face Morph effect is another popular effect. This one lets you morph and transition between multiple images of someone else's face. The effect may be under TikTok's Templates area because it employs graphics rather than video.

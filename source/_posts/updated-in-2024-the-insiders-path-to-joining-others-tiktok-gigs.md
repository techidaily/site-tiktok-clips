Likigram has also launched a Tik Tok money calculator with impressive specs. As you get into the user interface, it's quite interactive and easy to use. You just need to enter the Tik Tok name to get all the related information about your particular account's earning potential. They mention three crucial factors behind the earning purposes on Tik Tok i.e., hearts, real-time engagement, and follower count. All you need to maintain these three aspects to get into the Tik Tok earning potential.

Stunning analytics is consumed by the platform to measure these points at a certain level. For engagement, you can even buy fans, followers, and likes from Likigram. However, we'd not recommend this kind of commitment if it will be unreal. In case they are helping you get real followers and likes, then it's okay for paid services.

* Some paid services for real-time engagement

**Cons**

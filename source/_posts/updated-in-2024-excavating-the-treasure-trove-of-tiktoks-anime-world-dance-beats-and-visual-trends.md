### 9\. [A Cook Named Matt](https://www.tiktok.com/@acooknamedmatt)

While there are a lot of home chefs on TikTok, there are only a few who are professionals, and the accounts are dedicated to creating high-quality, delicious food. Matt Broussard is one of the most professional TikTok food accounts creating everything from Wagyu steak and spatzle.

The videos are very easy to understand and follow, allowing anyone to recreate the recipes at home. This TikTok food account is for the real food connoisseurs who love quality and extravagant taste.

### 10\. [Chef Chris Cho](https://www.tiktok.com/@chefchrischo?refer=embed)

Chef Chris Cho’s TikTok account has a whole vibe of its own, unlike any other food account. While others are peppy or serious, his account reflects a complete uber-cool and punk vibe as each video begins with, “ Yo! This is how you make..”

If you want to learn more about authentic and fusion Korean food, then we highly recommend Chef Chris. Filled with delicious recipes, hacks and fun, his videos have a class of their own. The way he talks into the camera makes you feel part of his crew, and you feel like you are standing right next to him in his kitchen.

### 11\. [That Dude Can Cook](https://www.tiktok.com/@thatdudecancook)

Cooking food is a lot of fun especially when the person in the video is full of energy. Their energy easily transfers in us and in no time we are enjoying cooking with them. One such person is Sonny Hurrel, a professional chef who makes delicious new recipes everytime.

The videos are packed with fun, interesting hacks and very easy to follow.

Sonny does not use too many intricate ingredients and neither uses complicated moves. His recipes are very simple for beginners and his sense of humor certainly adds to the fun.

![that dude can cook-tiktok video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/11-best-tiktok-food-accounts.png)

### 12\. [The Moody Foody](https://www.tiktok.com/@theemoodyfoody)

Don’t we all just love satisfying videos, so imagine a satisfying food video account on TikTok which has two of our favourite things in it? Fabrizio Villalpando is an expert in cooking delicious food. He gets you addicted to his fantastic recipes and slow chopping videos.

The videos by The Moody Foody will envelop you in a calm and peaceful vibe. With light music playing in the background and smooth pealing and chopping sounds, you won’t be able to stop yourself from watching them. This is such a nice change from the hyperactive vibe of TikTok.

![the moody foody-tiktok video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/12-best-tiktok-food-accounts.png)

### 13\. [Thisisiona](https://www.tiktok.com/@thisisiona)

There are very few accounts on TikTok that show the importance of comfort food and how cooking and eating can be beautiful and enjoyable. If you love healthy food and enjoy making new recipes in the kitchen then you will love Iona’s whole vibe.

The videos are informational as well as fun. You get to learn a lot about cutting down toxic food choices and how to make healthy and delicious food. In case you are just a beginner, Thisisiona is a great place to start your new healthy cooking lifestyle.

### 14\. [What Willy](https://www.tiktok.com/@whatwilly)

There are certain food accounts on TikTok that are funny, but nothing matches what WhatWilly has in store for you. Will Huges not just cooks some tasty food for you but also is a great comedian, making you laugh while you are trying to follow the recipe.

His videos are the perfect balance of information and jokes that will make you laugh out loud.

So if you are a little bit down, we highly recommend you go to Will’s account and enjoy some comfort food and some laughs.

![what willy-tiktok video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/14-best-tiktok-food-accounts.png)

### 15\. [Eitan](https://www.tiktok.com/@eitan?lang=en)

If you have ever seen any of Eitan Bernath’s videos then it might be shocking to hear that the boy is only 19 years old. Looking wise beyond his years and with a passion for cooking, you will instantly be hooked to Eitan’s videos.

Other than cooking yummy new recipes, Eitan delves in recreating popular TikTok food trends and recreating popular restaurant chain food at home. Eitan started his journey when he was 12 and has been gaining followers since then with his fantastic energy and genuine vibe.

![eitan-tiktok video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/15-best-tiktok-food-accounts.png)

So, These are the fifteen most popular and fun TikTok food accounts. While many other chefs are also doing a pretty good job we wanted to narrow down the list to just 15.

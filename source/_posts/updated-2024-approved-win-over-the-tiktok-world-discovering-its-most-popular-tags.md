## Part 3: How to Use TikTok Trending Hashtags Effectively?

Using hashtags for TikTok can be a little tricky. So, here are some tips that will help in getting the optimum results.

### Find Relevant Hashtags

When you browse content from your competitor, check out the hashtags they are using for their viral or popular posts. In case it seems like a hectic process, you can take the help of a hashtag generator tool for finding the right hashtags to use for your content.

### Combine Popular Hashtags on TikTok with the Less Popular Ones

One of the primary benefits of using hashtags is that many people search for them. However, there is fierce competition when it comes to popular hashtags. So, you are more likely to get noticed in a narrower niche when you use less competitive and smaller hashtags.

![combine trending tiktok hashtags](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/combine-popular-tiktok-hashtags.png)

Once you start becoming popular with smaller hashtags, you are likely to climb up the larger hashtag feed. This is the reason you should mix both types of hashtags.

### Follow Trends and Use Current Hashtag

So, you are using a hashtag in December and ‘#merrychristmas’ is a popular hashtag to use. However, there is no point in using the same hashtag in February. Hashtag trends keep rising and falling but it is necessary to ensure that the hashtags you are using your content is current.

### Go for Branded Hashtags

When you create your own branded hashtags, it will help your followers find you. In fact, you can reach out to more users with your branded hashtags on this social media platform in comparison to the other social media platforms.

![branded tiktok hashtags](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/branded-tiktok-hashtags.jpg)

As a matter of fact, if you want, you can come up with your own hashtag challenge. You can challenge your users to develop content and then tag them using your branded hashtag. These challenges work exceptionally well on TikTok as they can get users to inspire each other to develop content.

### The More the Better

Using just one hashtag is not going to help. Every hashtag you use is going to expose you to a different set of audiences. So, use as many hashtags as possible.

TikTok places a limitation of 100 characters. This implies you have to keep the hashtags shorts and simple to fit as many as you can.

Some users tend to use the #hashtag in their comments when they run out of the character limit for the caption. These hashtags might work but they aren’t as effective as the ones you include in the caption. So, make sure that you are adding the important hashtags to the captions.

When you use your **top TikTok hashtags** strategically, you can make the most of the content.

## Part 4: Bonus Tip- Use Powerful Video Editor to Create TikTok Videos

At times, even the most popular TikTok hashtags don’t work. This might be due to the poor quality of the video. In that case, you can use a powerful video creator and editor to create your videos.

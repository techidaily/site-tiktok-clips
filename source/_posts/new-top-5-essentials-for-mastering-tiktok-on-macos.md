## Unlock the Speed Dial: Tips and Tricks to Fast Forward on TikTok

When we state that TikTok is a gift, we know that we speak for many, if not all. Undoubtedly, it made the summer of 2020 much more bearable, and today it has become a leader in entertainment for the rest of the globe. The software has had a profound impact on many people's daily lives.

Only a few factors hold TikTok back from becoming the finest among the best. One of the drawbacks is that it doesn't allow you to pause or fast-forward. There are instances when you would like to go back and review a particular video from a TikTok and wouldn't want to have to watch the entire thing again to see it. So far, it appears like that's the case. Or is it? We have come here with the answers to all of your questions in this **'How to Fast Forward on TikTok'** guide. Let's explore!

#### In this article

01 [How to Fast Forward on Tiktok When Playing?](#part1)

02 [How to Record Fast Motion Video on TikTok on iPhone and Android?](#part2)

03 [How to Add Fast Motion Effect to Uploaded Video on TikTok?](#part3)

04 [How to Download A TikTok Video to Fast Forward on iPhone and Android?](#part4)

05 [How to Fast Forward Videos in TikTok on a PC?](#part5)

## Part 1: How to Fast Forward on Tiktok When Playing?

TikTok videos include a progress bar, which allows you to jump between them; nevertheless, this feature is not accessible for all videos. For the time being, the function is only visible on lengthier films.

Although it is unlikely, it is also possible to download a TikTok clip and then fast forward or rewind it at your convenience without using the TikTok app. But how to do it is the real question here. Follow the steps below to learn the trick:

**Step 1:** Find a **white progress bar** at the bottom of the clip on TikTok by opening the app and selecting it.

![tiktok video playback white progress bar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-video-playback-white-progress-bar.jpg)

**Step 2:** The dot on the progress bar that appears like a white line may be moved forward or backward by tapping and dragging it along the bar. Note that the revised location will be reflected above the bar in the first timecode number.

## Part 4: How to Download A TikTok Video to Fast Forward on iPhone and Android?

TikTok users were not allowed to fast forward or rewind videos inside the app for the longest time. TikTok recently added this feature; however, this new feature is not accessible for all users.

So, for those of you without this feature, we have found a way around it to let you fast forward and rewind your favorite TikTok videos; download them and that too without watermark on your iPhone or Android. Here's how.

**Step 1:** Open the TikTok app, and select the video that you wish to download for fast-forwarding or rewinding.

**Step 2:** Share this video page by clicking on the arrow icon located at the bottom-right of the page. If the publisher has enabled the download feature, you'll be able to save the video to your gallery.

In addition, you can simply fast forward and rewind video recordings on a computer with relative ease. To learn more, just follow these easy steps:

**Step 1:** Log in to your TikTok account by going to the TikTok website on your PC.

**Step 2:** Once you're on the home page, click on any video that you may wish to view.

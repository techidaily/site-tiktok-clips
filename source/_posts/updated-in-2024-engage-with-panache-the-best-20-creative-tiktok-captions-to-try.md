Tap on the **Download Video** option and wait for the download process to be completed. You won't have to wait long, as the app downloads videos faster than the TikTok app.

### Downloading Videos From TikTok Using the Downloader for Musical.ly app

The process of downloading videos from TikTok with [Downloader for Musical.ly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.galaxyapps.musicallysave) is identical to the process of downloading videos with Video Downloader for Musical.ly app.

You just have to copy the link of the video in the TikTok app, paste it to the Downloader for Musical.ly app and hit **Download**.

However, the app contains adds which can be a bit frustrating if you're planning on using it on a daily basis.

The web-based version of the TikTok platform called [Musical.ly Videos](https://musicallyvideos.com/) enables its users to browse through thousands of videos from their computers.

However, the download option is not available, so in order to save MP4 video files to a PC computer, you must first install the [5KPlayer](https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/) that lets you download videos from all video sharing platforms.

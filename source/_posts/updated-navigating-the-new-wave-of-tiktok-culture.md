On TikTok and any other social media, trending content comes with full marketing potential. By following the trends, you can draw in a large base of a highly engaged audience. Also, algorithms recognize the popular trend content. Thus, when you get involved, you can improve your reach and start growing your account.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Becoming an instant online celebrity with millions of followers has never been easier. This trend started on [YouTube](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and has spread to other social media like [TikTok](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [Instagram](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). TikTok has already conquered the Asian market, but in recent years this video-sharing and social networking app is becoming popular across the globe.

Standing out from TikTok isn’t as easy as you thought, because you will face fierce competition, and you must do everything you can to improve the quality of the content you share on TikTok. So, in this article, we will look at the best TikTok video editing apps that will enable you to produce content that attracts millions of viewers.

## How to Use the TikTok’s Built-in Video Editing Tools

In addition to viewing the content posted by other TikTok users, the app lets you record and edit videos. The video editing tools you are going to have at your disposal are basic but still powerful enough to enable you to enhance the 15 and 60-second videos you capture with TikTok.

To start making a new video, you have to tap on the + icon that is located at the bottom of the app’s home screen and then tap on the red Video button on the app’s Shooting page. Before you start recording, tap on the Add a Sound option if you would like to choose a song or an audio effect you would like to add to a video you’re creating.

Moreover, the app lets you [control the video’s playback speed](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), apply filters and effects or activate the Beauty mode before you start shooting. As we already noted, a video you record with TikTok cannot be longer than 60 seconds. Hence, after you capture your comedy sketch or create a music video, you’ll be able to [apply stickers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), voice or sound effects, filters, and visual effects or add [text layers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Each video you create with TikTok is different, which means that you have to try out different options in order to get the most out of the footage you record with this app. In addition, you can trim videos that are longer than 15 seconds and [adjust the volume](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) of a video’s original sound or the volume of its soundtrack.

The set of video and audio editing tools TikTok app provides can limit your options during the video editing process, but you can easily solve this issue by tapping on the Upload button that is located in the bottom right corner of the Shooting page.

This option enables you to use a video editing app that offers more advanced video editing tools to polish your videos before you upload them to TikTok. Once you are done editing, you can proceed to [add the description of the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and choose if you want to enable comments, reactions, or give your followers the option to create duets.

## Best Video Editing Apps for Creating TikTok Videos

The video editing options TikTok offers are not versatile enough to allow you to perform complex video editing tasks.

Becoming an instant online celebrity with millions of followers has never been easier. This trend started on [YouTube](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and has spread to other social media like [TikTok](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [Instagram](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). TikTok has already conquered the Asian market, but in recent years this video-sharing and social networking app is becoming popular across the globe.

Standing out from TikTok isn’t as easy as you thought, because you will face fierce competition, and you must do everything you can to improve the quality of the content you share on TikTok. So, in this article, we will look at the best TikTok video editing apps that will enable you to produce content that attracts millions of viewers.

## How to Use the TikTok’s Built-in Video Editing Tools

In addition to viewing the content posted by other TikTok users, the app lets you record and edit videos. The video editing tools you are going to have at your disposal are basic but still powerful enough to enable you to enhance the 15 and 60-second videos you capture with TikTok.

To start making a new video, you have to tap on the + icon that is located at the bottom of the app’s home screen and then tap on the red Video button on the app’s Shooting page.

Moreover, the app lets you [control the video’s playback speed](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), apply filters and effects or activate the Beauty mode before you start shooting. As we already noted, a video you record with TikTok cannot be longer than 60 seconds. Hence, after you capture your comedy sketch or create a music video, you’ll be able to [apply stickers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), voice or sound effects, filters, and visual effects or add [text layers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Each video you create with TikTok is different, which means that you have to try out different options in order to get the most out of the footage you record with this app. In addition, you can trim videos that are longer than 15 seconds and [adjust the volume](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) of a video’s original sound or the volume of its soundtrack.

The set of video and audio editing tools TikTok app provides can limit your options during the video editing process, but you can easily solve this issue by tapping on the Upload button that is located in the bottom right corner of the Shooting page.

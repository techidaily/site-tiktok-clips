## Maximizing Video Impact on TikTok Using Computer/Tablet

With the increasing trend of using Tiktok to make viral videos, every other person out there is trying their hand at this video-sharing platform.

## **Conclusion**

Tiktok videos are not only about following the trends; in fact, you can use them to create brand awareness, market your product or services, or engage with your audience in an effective way. However, the key is to make a video worth watching! And while Tiktok’s built-in editor has many tools, it comes with certain limitations.

If you want to make your video more exciting and different from the rest, you can always go for an external video editor, like Wondershare Filmora, and edit videos on your desktop. I hope our steps on how to create successful Tiktok videos on desktop, Android, and iPhone will come in handy and increase your Tiktok followers!

Launch the tool, and click on the “+” sign to import the Tiktok video you want to edit.

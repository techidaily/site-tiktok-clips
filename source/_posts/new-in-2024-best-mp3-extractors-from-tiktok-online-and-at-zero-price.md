2. Drop the video file on the timeline. Click on the ‘Title’ tab and select a text style you prefer. Enter the words you find funny and alter the color, font, and caption size. Another thing you should try is using a popular song in the background. For this, simply drag and drop the music file and place the audio track on the timeline.

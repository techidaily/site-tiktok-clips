## Conclusion

Although the TikTok app is only compatible with Android and iOS operating systems, Mac and PC users can also record or post videos on this social network directly from their computers by using the BlueStacks emulator. However, Mac users have experienced difficulties while installing this emulator on their devices, which is the reason why you need to make sure that your device meets all the technical requirements before you decide to install the BlueStacks on your computer.

TikTok offers an easy and fun way to create short music videos that have cool filters and visual effects, and share them with millions of people.

## FAQs

### Q1\. What is an Emulator?

In computing, emulator is a software or hardware that makes your computer system act like another system. For example, there were previously famous PlayStation 1 emulators, which allowed users to play PS1 games on their PCs. Likewise, having an Android emulator on your desktop or laptop will enable you to download and run mobile applications on your system.

### Q2\. What is BlueStacks, and why is it famous?

BlueStacks is a free and famous emulator for running Android applications on Windows and macOS. And it is totally legal to download and run BlueStacks on your system, as the company is partnered with some industry-leading organizations, such as Intel, Samsung, and AMD.

### Q3\. Why is BlueStacks so slow?

There could be a few reasons for slow BlueStacks on your computer. However, the most authentic one is outdated software. So, if you are using an older version of BlueStacks, go to the website and download the latest version.

### Q4\. How do I stop BlueStacks from lagging?

You can do a couple of things to stop your BlueStacks from lagging. First, turn on the “Virtualization.” Second, ensure you have allocated your CPU cores and RAM details in BlueStacks settings. Third, go to “Control Panel” and set your laptop/PC to “High Performance.” Fourth, you must have GPU drivers installed in your system. Fifth, close all other programs when using BlueStacks to make sure the RAM supports your emulator. And lastly, try to have an updated and correctly installed antivirus (if any).

### Q5\. Why won’t TikTok Work on BlueStacks 5?

You are required to download the latest version of BlueStacks to run TikTok. Next, make sure you have installed “Pie 64-bit Instance” from your BlueStacks “Multi-instance Manager.” Once done, open the Play Store, search for TikTok, download the app, and run.

_**Note:** If you are using Nougat 64-bit/32-bit you won’t be able to run TikTok on BlueStacks 5\._

### Q6\. Does BlueStacks damage the PC?

Not at all! The creators of BlueStacks claim that this emulator is entirely safe for MAC and PC users.

### Q7\. Can I run BlueStacks 5 on a PC with 2GB RAM?

You must have at least 4GB RAM with 5GB free disk space to run BlueStacks 5 on your system.

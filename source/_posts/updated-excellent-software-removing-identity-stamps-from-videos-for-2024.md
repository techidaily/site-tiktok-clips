 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Whether you love it or hate it, you must have heard about an App in 2020 - TikTok. Due to the outbreak of Covid-19, TikTok became one of the fastest-growing apps on both the App Store and Google Play. Teenagers are obsessed with it, but their parents don’t understand it. The government fears it, but companies eager to make money off it. TikTok probably has been the most controversial (and prevalent) social network ever.

What makes TikTok different? Initially, Tiktok is famous for its 15-second short videos, and most of the videos are lip-syncing videos. Gradually, it evolved into a community mixed with music, lip-syncing, and micro-video content. Besides providing access to an impressive music library, the app also offers a rich selection of video editing tools, which makes videos go viral quickly.

However, the US government has threatened to ban TikTok in the US recently after it had been banned in India. The growing uncertainties of TikTok has driven so many users to look for **TikTok alternatives**. In this article, we will go through some of the best options available to both iPhone and Android users.

* [Dubsmash](#part1)
* [Funimate](#part2)
* [Cheez](#part3)
* [Triller](#part4)
* [Likee](#part5)

## Top 5 Alternatives to the TikTok App

Members of TikTok - including the Musical.ly community can't create videos longer than one minute, which can potentially limit their options while recording music videos. What's more, the app's video editing capabilities are somewhat limited, since producing the cloning effect and numerous other effects require you to use more powerful video editing apps. To help you overcome these obstacles, we've selected some of the best music video apps on the market, so here are the five best **alternatives to TikTok**.

#### 1\. [Dubsmash](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dubsmash/id918820076?mt=8)

![Dubsmash](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dubsmash.png)

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

**Price:** Free

It is probably one of the oldest music video apps for Android and iOS-based devices that lost a bit of its former glory with the rise of Musical.ly. The fact that Dubmash has over one hundred million installs speaks volumes about its popularity today. By downloading this app, you're becoming a part of a large community that revolves around entertaining lip-sync videos.

You can use thousands of different sounds in your videos, including movie and TV quotes, which means that you'll always have fresh material for your videos. The app lets you add stickers and text overlays to videos so that you can make even more captivating music videos. The app displays videos in the style of Snapchat stories divided into two news feed sections so you can follow the channels you like and keep track of the latest videos posted by your friends. Besides enabling you to post music videos on your Dumbmash profile, the app lets you share your videos on other social media networks. You can save each video you produce with this app to your camera roll.

Can you believe it? Lots of movie stars are big fans of this app and Penelope Cruz is one of them.

#### 2\. [Funimate](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/funimate-music-video-maker/id844570015?mt=8)

![Funimate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/funimate.jpg)

Funimate features more than twenty advanced video effects that turn ordinary everyday moments into magical viral music videos. In addition, you can add as much text or stickers to a video as you want, so you can easily add funny comments to each video you record with this app. Making collab videos with your friends is comfortable with Funimate as you have to pick a song you both like and merge the footage into a single clip.

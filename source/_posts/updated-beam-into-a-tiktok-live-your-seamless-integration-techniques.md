![ Saving TikTok Video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/musically-videos-homepage.jpg)

The web-based version of the TikTok platform called [Musical.ly Videos](https://musicallyvideos.com/) enables its users to browse through thousands of videos from their computers.

However, the download option is not available, so in order to save MP4 video files to a PC computer, you must first install the [5KPlayer](https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/) that lets you download videos from all video sharing platforms.

![ Saving TikTok Video using 5kplayer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5kplayer-download-video.jpg)

You can download a video from the Muscial.ly video platform in just two simple steps. You first have to find the video you'd like to save to your computer and open its **preview page**.

Afterwards, you should just **copy the video's URL** and paste it into the 5KPlayer. You can do this by clicking on the **Paste URL & Analyze button** in the 5KPlayer.

Once the thumbnail of the video is displayed you can just click on the **Download button** to save the MP4 video file to the desired location on your hard drive.

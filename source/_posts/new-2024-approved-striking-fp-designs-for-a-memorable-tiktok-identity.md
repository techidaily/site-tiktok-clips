On other social media platforms, the acronym stands for Picture for Proof. Thus, it basically is asking a user to send proof of what they are doing. Nonetheless, they are primarily associated with IM and Snapchat apps.

As TikTok is a video-sharing platform, PFP just stands for the profile picture.

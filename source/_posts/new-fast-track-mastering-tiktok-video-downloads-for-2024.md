## Method 1: Downloading Your TikTok Videos to Your Smartphone

Both iPhone and Android users can install the TikTok app on their devices, and the process of downloading videos with this app to the camera roll is identical for iOS and Android operating systems.

All you have to do is launch the TikTok app from your phone and tap on the **Account icon** that is located in the bottom right corner of the app's main window.

## Method 2: Using the Video Downloader Apps to Download other TikTok Videos

The process of downloading videos to a Smartphone directly from the TikTok app can be quite slow, so if you want to save videos from this video sharing platform to your phone in no time you can try using some of the downloader apps for Musical.ly that are available at the Google Play store.

### Downloading TikTok Videos With the Video Downloader for Musical.ly

Tap on the **Download Video** option and wait for the download process to be completed. You won't have to wait long, as the app downloads videos faster than the TikTok app.

### Downloading Videos From TikTok Using the Downloader for Musical.ly app

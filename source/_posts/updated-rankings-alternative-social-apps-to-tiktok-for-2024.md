Whether you love it or hate it, you must have heard about an App in 2020 - TikTok.

The government fears it, but companies eager to make money off it. TikTok probably has been the most controversial (and prevalent) social network ever.

What makes TikTok different? Initially, Tiktok is famous for its 15-second short videos, and most of the videos are lip-syncing videos.

## **Conclusion**

Tiktok videos are not only about following the trends; in fact, you can use them to create brand awareness, market your product or services, or engage with your audience in an effective way. However, the key is to make a video worth watching! And while Tiktok’s built-in editor has many tools, it comes with certain limitations.

If you want to make your video more exciting and different from the rest, you can always go for an external video editor, like Wondershare Filmora, and edit videos on your desktop. I hope our steps on how to create successful Tiktok videos on desktop, Android, and iPhone will come in handy and increase your Tiktok followers!

**Step 2**

Launch the tool, and click on the “+” sign to import the Tiktok video you want to edit.

![to import the video for editing, click on the “ + ” sign.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/2-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

**Step 3**

Once your video clip is successfully imported to the timeline, it’s time to get editing! Filmora offers many basic and advanced editing tools to give a professional touch to your Tiktok videos.

For example, you can:

* Add audio to your videos from a vast library of tracks for all occasions.

Apart from this, you can also add the slo-mo effect and play the video backward for added fun.

**Step 4**

Once you have edited the Tiktok video to your heart’s content, you can preview it to see if any further changes are required. After that, you can export it to your Android or iOS device to upload directly from the Tiktok app.

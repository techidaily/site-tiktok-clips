## How to Craft an Original TikTok Tag Identifier

TikTok is one of the most famous social media platforms that many people use on a daily basis. Due to high traffic on TikTok, you can reach a larger audience instantly. Through TikTok, you can efficiently market and promote your e-commerce products with live streaming. Moreover, if you are holding an event or conference, you can connect with multiple people through TikTok live streaming.

If you are willing to live stream on TikTok through your PC, you would need a TikTok stream key. To know **how to get the TikTok stream key**, this article will help you.

1. [Way 1\. With OBS](#part3-1)
2. [Way 2\. With Streamlabs](#part3-2)

* [Bonus Tips: Easily Record and Edit Your Stream with Filmora](#part4)

## Part 1: What is Stream Key?

A stream key is a combination of random letters and numbers which stores the information of your account. It allows different streaming software to live stream your video on your preferred platform. To use streaming software such as OBS Studio for live streaming, the stream key will help you connect with your preferred platform.

If you are using the YouTube platform, its stream key will consist of all the related information, such as login details and permissions. That's why you should keep the streaming key of your platform confidential. Thus, the stream key can prevent you from hassle as you don’t have to sign in with your YouTube account on OBS Studio for live streaming.

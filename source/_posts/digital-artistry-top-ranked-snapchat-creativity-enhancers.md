From kids to grown-ups, everyone uses these filters for fun, to make themselves look weird, cool, or just a bit nicer. Snapchat has plenty of lenses and cool filters, making people fall in love with the app. People can also create their filters and help them engage with their brands and businesses. Let's explore some of the best Snapchat filters of 2021!

## Part 1: Most Popular Snapchat Filters for Selfies in 2021

**Let's have a look at the most popular Snapchat filters for selfies as we all know there's a big range to choose from!**

#### 1\.  Fire Sunglasses

Whenever the users are feeling energetic and motivated, they use the "fire sunglasses" filter. They want to show everyone that they're on fire, and there couldn't be a better filter than this. It provides the users with a pair of glasses with fire on the glass, which adds to the energy.

The fire on the contacts gives you a fiery and relaxed look that catches people's attention. People can use it after their workouts or for motivational posts. This filter puts up an uplifting mood and gives you good vibes, but it might not be best suited for everyone.

#### 2\.  Neon Horns

The Classic filter, the devil's horn but in neon! Incredibly catchy to the eye and gives you a devilish look. This filter is a classic and is here to stay for a long time; there's no doubt in that.

For the first time, Horn Filters have taken one step further and given it a neon effect, making it even more appealing. The user can change the horn color; various options have been offered, such as black and white. Some more color options include lime green, magenta, orange, and light blue. It is an evergreen filter but has limited use. Want to know the best part? It sits perfectly according to your filter and does not glitch at all.

Cartoon 3D Style, one of the most popular filters on Snapchat and has every right to be! It gives you that unique specific animated look making you look like you just stepped out of a Disney movie. This filter adjusts itself according to our face cut and turns into Disney cartoons such as Kristoff.

People love to fool around with funny filters, and this one here has to be the best of them all. It gets better: from children to adults, everyone has undoubtedly used this filter. This filter has a soft shading giving it that artistic look like it had been hand-drawn; it's pretty fun when you make different faces with the filter on your face.

#### 4\.  Scary Mask

When people get bored from typical filters and don't get much response, they use funny or scary filters, which are way more fun. But here's the kicker: this filter covers half your face with a golden skull mask and turns your eyes into a golden flame color too. If we look at this from a different perspective, this can also spread awareness to wear masks during these challenging times. This filter has received so much response from the Snapchat users and finds a place in the "best filters on Snapchat" list!

If youâ€™re a Snapchat user, you will have spotted the [emojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that appear in your friends list next to the names of your friends. These **Snapchat emojis** donâ€™t simply remain the same forever, but instead change over the course of time, and the changes themselves are based on the way that you interact with your friend. Only you are able to see the emojis. The Snapchat emojis themselves include stars, hearts, faces and more.

* [**Part2: How to change the streak emojis on Snapchat**](#part2)
* [**Part3: How to get a Bitmoji on Snapchat**](#part3)
* [**Part4: Why to use Snapchat emojis**](#part4)

## Part 1: What do exactly the Snapchat emojis mean?

In this section, we will tell you all about the different emojis on Snapchat. If youâ€™ve been wondering what the Snap emoji meanings actually are, read on. A Gold Star next to someoneâ€™s name means they have replaced your snaps during the past 24 hours. A Yellow Star means you are #1 best friends with one another. You will send your largest amount of snaps to them and vice versa.

A Red Heart snap emoji is used to say that you have been #1 Bfs for a fortnight without interruption, whilst a Pink Heart Snapchat best friend emoji tells that that this has been the case for two months. If you see a baby emoji, this means you have only recently become friends with the person.

![snapchat emojis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-emojis.JPG)

Have you seen a Face with Sunglasses? This means the person is B.Fs with one of your best friends and you send plenty of snaps to someone that they send many snaps to. A Grimacing Face tells you that your #1 is also their #1 friend and that the person you send the most snaps to is the same person they send the vast majority of their snaps to.

The Smirking Face shows that you are one of their B.Fs without this being reciprocated. In other words, they send you many snaps but you donâ€™t return the favor. A Smiling Face means that you are good friends with someone but they arenâ€™t quite your #1 B.F.

## Part 2: How to change the streak emojis on Snapchat

![bitmoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bitmoji-setting.JPG)

#### 2\. Agree and connect

You will now be able to link your Bitmoji account up to your Snapchat account. This means you can easily share your very own Bitmoji character with your followers on Snapchat and make the experience of using the service even more fun and personal to you.

![bitmoji-create](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bitmoji-create.JPG)

## Part 4: Why to use Snapchat emojis

There are many great reasons for using Snapchat. The platform first appeared way back in September and has attracted millions upon millions of users since then. Snapchat may be strongly associated with teenagers, but it is used by adults of all ages. When you use Snapchat, the content you share is more direct and personal and is only seen by the people you want to see it, for ten seconds only. Snapchat is great for privacy, and if anyone attempts to take a screenshot of your content you will be notified.

Another reason so many people use Snapchat is that there are no complex settings to leave you confused. It also simplifies the video calling process and makes it much less complicated than other video communication platforms. Snapchat has also become a major marketing tool for businesses around the world, allowing them to connect with and promote their services to a wider range of tech-loving users.

The Smirking Face shows that you are one of their B.Fs without this being reciprocated. In other words, they send you many snaps but you donâ€™t return the favor. A Smiling Face means that you are good friends with someone but they arenâ€™t quite your #1 B.F.

## Part 3: How to get a Bitmoji on Snapchat

Snapchat purchased Bitmoji creator Bitstrips in 2016 in an attempt to capitalise on the popularity of emojis. It is now possible to link your Bitmoji account to your Snapchat one, and it only takes a few moments to connect the two. By doing so, you can enjoy greater customisation options and enhance the experience of using Snapchat.

Take these steps if you wish to get a personal Bitmoji on Snapchat.

#### 1\. Open your Snapchat settings

Swipe down on your home screen, tapping the gear icon located in the top right-hand corner of your screen.

You can find this in the â€˜My Accountâ€™ section. Those that have already registered with Bitmoji will be able to link their account in the next step, but if you havenâ€™t, you will need to set up a new Bitmoji account.

#### 2\. Agree and connect

You will now be able to link your Bitmoji account up to your Snapchat account. This means you can easily share your very own Bitmoji character with your followers on Snapchat and make the experience of using the service even more fun and personal to you.

#### 3\. Send Snaps using your new Bitmoji character

Everything is set up for you to make the most of linking Bitmoji to Snapchat. Your Bitmoji is now stored in your regular emoji tab and can be seen under the icon which resembles a face.

## Part 4: Why to use Snapchat emojis

There are many great reasons for using Snapchat. The platform first appeared way back in September and has attracted millions upon millions of users since then. Snapchat may be strongly associated with teenagers, but it is used by adults of all ages. When you use Snapchat, the content you share is more direct and personal and is only seen by the people you want to see it, for ten seconds only. Snapchat is great for privacy, and if anyone attempts to take a screenshot of your content you will be notified.

Another reason so many people use Snapchat is that there are no complex settings to leave you confused. It also simplifies the video calling process and makes it much less complicated than other video communication platforms. Snapchat has also become a major marketing tool for businesses around the world, allowing them to connect with and promote their services to a wider range of tech-loving users.

## Conclusion

More and more people are using Bitmoji to change the emojis on Snapchat. When you use Bitmoji to change your Snap emojis, you can make an excellent statement about yourself. Snapchat brings friends closer together, and itâ€™s said that the platform had more daily users than Twitter in 2016\. The creators of Snapchat actually failed 34 projects before their innovation became a success, which shows that perseverance can pay off. Why not change your Snapchat emojis today?

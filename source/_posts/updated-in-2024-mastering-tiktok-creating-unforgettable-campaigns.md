## What Is Tiktok Reaction Video

Reaction videos are exactly what they sound like — a video of someone reacting to something. Reaction videos have been around since the early days of YouTube when people would upload their reactions to music, movies, and TV shows. But with the launch of TikTok in 2017, reaction videos exploded in popularity. They are one of the most popular video types on social media platforms.

Reaction videos are a type of video where people record their reactions to other content as it unfolds before them. Reaction videos are popular on TikTok because they elicit an emotional response from the viewer. The most common emotions are joy, sadness, surprise, disgust, fear, and anger. It's easy to see why these videos are so popular — they're fun!

## Why Are TikTok Videos So Popular?

The popularity of TikTok reaction videos is easy to understand. It is fun to watch people react to something they're seeing for the very first time. In addition, these types of videos are entertaining and silly. They are typically not too serious or dramatic in tone.

Reaction videos allow you to laugh at yourself or laugh with someone else who has been through something similar (or even worse). If someone else has gone through it before, the chances are that they've learned from their mistakes too! This could be an important lesson for you as well!

## Make a TikTok video Easily using Filmora

If you look at the built-in video editor of the TikTok app, you will notice that the interface is not user-friendly at all. But this does not mean there is no way to make a TikTok music video. Filmora is an advanced video editor for both Mac and PC that has many features that make it a great choice for TikTok videos. We'll walk you through the process:

**Step 1:** First of all, make sure that the latest version of Filmora Video editor is downloaded on your computer. If you haven't already installed it, you can easily download it from the official website of Wondershare.

**Step 2:** Now, Install the application and run it on your computer.

**Step 3:** A window will appear on your screen where you need to select the new project option.

**Step 4:** In the next step, you need to select the aspect ratio. Keep in mind that by default, the aspect ratio will be 16:9, which is landscape, but since the TikTok videos are in portrait orientation, we need to select 9:16 and click ok.

**Step 5:** Now, you can import the media files to your Filmora library. Just click on the file, select import media, and click on the Import media files. Now select the video files that you want to edit, and they will be imported to your Filmora Library.

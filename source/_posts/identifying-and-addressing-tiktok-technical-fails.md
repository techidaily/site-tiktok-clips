### 4\. Clear TikTok App Cache

If your TikTok app is not operating, it's probably an issue with damaged cache data. If you notice, your TikTok app plays certain videos offline when you start it. It's not magic. The cache memory saves certain data temporarily to let the software operate quicker and function effectively. If your TikTok is acting improperly, deleting the cached data may help solve it. Follow the instructions below to do so.

* Launch the Settings app from your app menu, then click on the Apps & Notifications.

* From there, click on the option to see all applications. Usually "App details", "Manage Applications", or "See all apps".

### 5\. Reset the Network

TikTok has become a very frequently used app globally, however occasionally its users have to confront certain challenges. Sometimes when viewing or recording a video, an error does not allow the app to play the video. This issue is not directly connected to the app; however, we may solve this mistake by utilizing alternative ways such as network difficulties. Sometimes our network is giving trouble to the system, and it is not supporting the videos we wish to play. So, the first and foremost duty to remove this problem is to examine our connection. To solve the connection difficulties or ISP APN, we need to take the following steps:

* Open the settings and click on the network and internet option. From there, click on the mobile network > Open ‘Advanced Options’

* Click on the access point names and select the three full stops in the upper right corner of your phone's screen.

* Then click on reset to default. After performing these instructions leave the settings, then go to your home screen and switch on the mobile data. Then play the video to see whether the fault is fixed.

### 6\. Restart the Devices

If TikTok works on another device or browser from the list above, your device seems to be the issue. If the issue continues, consider deleting the program and reinstalling it from the App Store for iOS users or Play Store for Android users. The first thing to do in the case of an application problem on your iPhone device is to switch off then on again. To achieve this, these are the steps to follow:

**For iOS:**

* To begin, touch and hold the Power button until you receive the “Slide to Power Off” option on your screen. Then move the slider to the right until the screen on your iPhone or iPad becomes dark.

* Wait at least 10 seconds after shutting off your iPhone before hitting and holding the Power button until the Apple logo shows on the screen.

![Hold the Power Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/tiktok-bugs-7.jpg)

![Login Tiktok Account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/tiktok-bugs-8.jpg)

## Part 4: Conclusion

Sometimes all that TikTok needs is an update. Someone else has undoubtedly run across whatever difficulty you are having earlier and the developer may have published an update that fixes the problem already. If none of the alternatives above work, remove your **TikTok app** according to your device. Go to the App Store or Google Play Store. Search for the **TikTok** **application** and install it. If you are on an Android smartphone, go to the Play Store, search for TikTok, and check if there is an update available.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Becoming an instant online celebrity with millions of followers has never been easier. This trend started on [YouTube](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and has spread to other social media like [TikTok](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [Instagram](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). TikTok has already conquered the Asian market, but in recent years this video-sharing and social networking app is becoming popular across the globe.

Standing out from TikTok isn’t as easy as you thought, because you will face fierce competition, and you must do everything you can to improve the quality of the content you share on TikTok. So, in this article, we will look at the best TikTok video editing apps that will enable you to produce content that attracts millions of viewers.

## How to Use the TikTok’s Built-in Video Editing Tools

In addition to viewing the content posted by other TikTok users, the app lets you record and edit videos. The video editing tools you are going to have at your disposal are basic but still powerful enough to enable you to enhance the 15 and 60-second videos you capture with TikTok.

To start making a new video, you have to tap on the + icon that is located at the bottom of the app’s home screen and then tap on the red Video button on the app’s Shooting page. Before you start recording, tap on the Add a Sound option if you would like to choose a song or an audio effect you would like to add to a video you’re creating.

Adding Texts in TikTok Video with TikTok: By Rhia

Moreover, the app lets you [control the video’s playback speed](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), apply filters and effects or activate the Beauty mode before you start shooting. As we already noted, a video you record with TikTok cannot be longer than 60 seconds. Hence, after you capture your comedy sketch or create a music video, you’ll be able to [apply stickers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), voice or sound effects, filters, and visual effects or add [text layers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Each video you create with TikTok is different, which means that you have to try out different options in order to get the most out of the footage you record with this app. In addition, you can trim videos that are longer than 15 seconds and [adjust the volume](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) of a video’s original sound or the volume of its soundtrack.

The set of video and audio editing tools TikTok app provides can limit your options during the video editing process, but you can easily solve this issue by tapping on the Upload button that is located in the bottom right corner of the Shooting page.

This option enables you to use a video editing app that offers more advanced video editing tools to polish your videos before you upload them to TikTok. Once you are done editing, you can proceed to [add the description of the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and choose if you want to enable comments, reactions, or give your followers the option to create duets.

## Best Video Editing Apps for Creating TikTok Videos

The video editing options TikTok offers are not versatile enough to allow you to perform complex video editing tasks. That is why a growing number of TikTok’s users opt for third-party apps that are equipped with the tools they can use to [improve the quality of the content](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) they share on this social network. Here are some of the [best video editing apps you can use on iOS](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or Android devices, as well as Mac and PC computers to create videos you share on TikTok.

Becoming an instant online celebrity with millions of followers has never been easier. This trend started on [YouTube](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and has spread to other social media like [TikTok](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [Instagram](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). TikTok has already conquered the Asian market, but in recent years this video-sharing and social networking app is becoming popular across the globe.

Standing out from TikTok isn’t as easy as you thought, because you will face fierce competition, and you must do everything you can to improve the quality of the content you share on TikTok. So, in this article, we will look at the best TikTok video editing apps that will enable you to produce content that attracts millions of viewers.

## How to Use the TikTok’s Built-in Video Editing Tools

In addition to viewing the content posted by other TikTok users, the app lets you record and edit videos. The video editing tools you are going to have at your disposal are basic but still powerful enough to enable you to enhance the 15 and 60-second videos you capture with TikTok.

To start making a new video, you have to tap on the + icon that is located at the bottom of the app’s home screen and then tap on the red Video button on the app’s Shooting page.

Hence, after you capture your comedy sketch or create a music video, you’ll be able to [apply stickers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), voice or sound effects, filters, and visual effects or add [text layers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Each video you create with TikTok is different, which means that you have to try out different options in order to get the most out of the footage you record with this app. In addition, you can trim videos that are longer than 15 seconds and [adjust the volume](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) of a video’s original sound or the volume of its soundtrack.

The set of video and audio editing tools TikTok app provides can limit your options during the video editing process, but you can easily solve this issue by tapping on the Upload button that is located in the bottom right corner of the Shooting page.

This option enables you to use a video editing app that offers more advanced video editing tools to polish your videos before you upload them to TikTok. Once you are done editing, you can proceed to [add the description of the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and choose if you want to enable comments, reactions, or give your followers the option to create duets.

## Best Video Editing Apps for Creating TikTok Videos

The video editing options TikTok offers are not versatile enough to allow you to perform complex video editing tasks. That is why a growing number of TikTok’s users opt for third-party apps that are equipped with the tools they can use to [improve the quality of the content](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) they share on this social network. Here are some of the [best video editing apps you can use on iOS](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or Android devices, as well as Mac and PC computers to create videos you share on TikTok.

### 1\. [iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193)

**Available for:** macOS, iOS

**What we like:**

* Free and easy to use
* Rich music and audio effect library
* Fully customizable trailer templates and themes

Over the course of the last two decades, iMovie has become one of the most reliable video editing apps for iPhone, iPad and Mac users who don’t have advanced video editing skills. iMovie lets you choose from 14 trailer templates and 8 themes so that you can easily [combine multiple video clips](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and create a soundtrack for them.

Additionally, this video editor for iOS and macOS devices grants you access to all the tools you are going to need to cut your footage, [create PIP](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or [green screen effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or record voiceovers for each video you edit with iMovie.

Additionally, you can adjust the Exposure, Vibrance or Shadows values in all video clips you import into a project you created in Adobe Rush.

TikTok content creators in need of an app that allows them to [create GIFs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or remove any part of an audio or video clip should consider installing this app for Android phones

Besides changing the format of your audio and video files Timbre also enables you to [customize the bitrate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) of those files and reduce their size.

![Vizmato: Video Editor & Filter for TikTok ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Vizmato-edit-tiktok-videos.jpg)

## Part 2: Benefits of Going Live on TikTok with Computer

There are various advantages of going live on TikTok with a PC. By doing so, you can ensure a better quality of your live streaming session. To learn more, let's discuss the details.

### 1\. Great Stability

### 2\. High Video/Audio Quality

iOS and Samsung devices provide high video quality. However, if you are using low-end smartphones, you won't get high video and audio quality. In such a circumstance, you should use your computer to maintain better quality. By doing so, your audience can listen and view your live streams flawlessly.

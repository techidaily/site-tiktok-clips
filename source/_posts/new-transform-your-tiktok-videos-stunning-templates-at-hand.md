Get a Knowledge of TikTok Videos

TikTok videos are short-form content. They can be up to 3 minutes in length. And that is their charm. Busy people looking for "bite-sized" content turn to this platform for entertainment.

The TikTok videos that become successful include filters, effects, stickers, voiceovers, and background music. They can be about different topics, so anyone can make them.

## Why Use Templates To Make TikTok Videos?

The competition on TikTok is tough. A content creator can publish multiple videos in one day because they're short, as long as they have ideas. So, attracting views with your videos is challenging.

If you can't keep up with how fast-paced other content creators are, you should ensure your videos are of high quality. But what if you run out of ideas?

That is where TikTok video templates come in. They are ready-to-use assets you can edit and personalize to make original videos quickly. By using templates, you can stand toe-to-toe with other content creators on the platform.

## Where To Find TikTok Video Templates?

## Part 2: How to Get a Green Screen Background from Someone's TikTok?

TikTok recently introduced a fantastic feature to customize or alter your video’s background without even looking for the green screen filter on your own. The “Green Screen Duet Feature.” This feature also lets users apply another person’s video as the background.

Green screens were once only available to those who had access to, well, a green screen. Now the case is different. You can utilize this "Green Screen" feature from the various applications now, allowing you to add a customizable background to your video, and TikTok is one of them. s Various content creators customize their background with effects, a still image, or even a video from their camera roll using the TikTok app.

Imagine scrolling down the TikTok app and finding an eye-catching customized background. Yes! You can utilize it to spice up your videos as well. We have already demonstrated how you can add a green screen effect in TikTok in your videos. But did you also know you can add green screen background from someone else's video to your TikTok? Even if you didn't, we have compiled a step-by-step guide that will give you a perfect depiction of how you can pull it off.

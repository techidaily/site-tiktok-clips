Before proceeding further, it's essential to consider whether any copyright infringement issues could arise from downloading a TikTok video. According to the Community Guidelines of TikTok, users cannot post, send, or share any content that violates someone else's trademarks, copyrights, or intellectual property rights.

To prevent this, TikTok applies a watermark featuring both its account’s username and the logo that originally posted the content if someone downloads a TikTok video.

Cropping watermarks from your videos with Wondershare Filmora video editing software is a pretty straightforward process. You don't need be a professional to finish these simple editing actions.

All you must do is choose a method that best suits your preferences and performs an easy action, though.

So, without any delay, let's have a look at some editing techniques you can use to blur or crop watermarks from the downloaded videos of TikTok with Filmora.

A mosaic square will appear after you apply it in the preview window by relocating it by simply dragging it to the preview window area or adjusting its size at the watermarked position.

If the downloaded video has more than one logo to hide, tapping the plus icon will introduce you to another mosaic square within the video

project.

In the timeline, double click those **Mosaic** effects; you can select **Blur Amount** and **Type** to adjust the shape and size of the mosaic. Hit the **OK** tab to apply the adjustment.

![select blur amount filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-mosaic-effect-adjust.jpg)

You can also consider using this Mosaic effect to blur other objects or even the face.

**Method 2: Remove watermark by Cropping the video**

This method will allow you to remove the watermark from your video entirely. Cropping the area where the watermark isn't possible in any video editor, so if you select to crop the video, be prepared to lose a particular section of the picture.

Right-click the video and choose the **Crop and Zoom** option once the footage you wish to crop is on the video track in Filmora's timeline.

![crop watermark filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crop-to-remove-watermark.jpg)

The crop window that enables you to use automatic aspect ratios or manually will appear on the screen. You can reposition the videos' corners of the cropping rectangle from here by dragging it as much as essential to remove TikTok's username watermark.

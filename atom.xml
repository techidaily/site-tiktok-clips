Here’s a handy guide on <strong>Triller vs TikTok</strong>.</p><p>On August 6, 2020, President Donald Trump announced that he would take steps to ban TikTok - the popular short-term video app from operating in the USA, unless the app’s US operations were sold to an American company. With a rising tide of uncertainties surrounding TikTok’s future in the United States, TikTokers and short-form video creators are getting drawn to rival platforms like Triller.</p><p>The Trump administration and other critics of TikTok fear that the data the app collects in its US users might end up in the hands of the Chinese government. However, TikTok has said that it stores users’ data outside China and that it would resist any attempts by Beijing to grab the information.</p><p>Amid these confidentiality concerns and an impending ban imposed by the Trump administration, more and more users are now switching to Triller. In fact, as TikTok faces uncertainties between being banned or bought in the US, rival app Triller has received a big boost and attained the No.1 spot in Apple’s US App Store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/triller-vs-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Triller Vs Tiktok"                ></p><p>With TikTok vs. Triller going on all around, here’s a detailed insight on everything you need to know about these social video apps.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is Triller &amp; What Is TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Who Uses Triller &amp; Tiktok?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Triller Vs TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How To Make Money On The Two Apps?</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-Is-Triller-What-Is-TikTok"><a href="#What-Is-Triller-What-Is-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="What Is Triller &amp; What Is TikTok?"></a>What Is Triller &amp; What Is TikTok?</h2><h4 id="Triller"><a href="#Triller" class="headerlink" title="Triller"></a>Triller</h4><p>Triller is an artificial intelligence-driven video app released in the year 2015, thus allowing users to film videos with music. Then, the video and music content is synced algorithmically, thus automating the editing part which users can manually do on TikTok. Users can record multiple takes of themselves and using AI, the app will compile the best clips together for creating a music video.</p><p>Triller is a music video app that’s specifically built for creators. In Triller, users can collaborate with each other, use custom or existing sounds, and filters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-triller.jpg"                      alt="What Is Triller"                ></p><h4 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h4><p>Launched in the year 2016, TikTok served the Chinese market originally. A year later, when TikTok appeared on mobile platforms around the world, it completely swept off the internet. Owned by ByteDance - a Beijing-based internet technology company, it is a Chinese social video-sharing app.</p><p>With this app, users can record a video with their smartphone, edit the video, add music, and then upload it on the platform. It is a short-form video sharing mobile app that lets users create and share 15-second videos on any topic. Today, with more than 800 million monthly active users and 1.5 billion downloads; TikTok is one of the most popular mobile applications worldwide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="What Is Tiktok"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="864" height="1296" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Who-Uses-Triller-Tiktok"><a href="#Who-Uses-Triller-Tiktok" class="headerlink" title="Who Uses Triller &amp; Tiktok?"></a>Who Uses Triller &amp; Tiktok?</h2><p>Triller, the most popular alternative to TikTok is one of the many video-led social applications that are riding a wave of anti-TikTok sentiments. In the words of Triller co-owner Ryan Kavanaugh, “We see ourselves as the adult version of TikTok”. The target audience of this music video-sharing app is between the age group of 17 to 27. Mainly, it is popular among top streaming artists, hip hop artists, and the music industry.</p><p>On the other hand, TikTok has a strong reputation for being popular with teenagers and young adults, the GenZ. While 27% of its total users are between the age group of 13-17 years, its largest age demographics (42%) are the younger adults. So when combined, the 13-24 age group represents about 69% of the app’s user base.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-uses-triller-vs-tiktok.jpeg"                      alt="Who Uses Triller Vs Tiktok"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484910/16446" target="_top" id="1484910">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484910" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484910/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Triller-Vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences"><a href="#Triller-Vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Triller Vs TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences"></a>Triller Vs TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</h2><p>At a glance, TikTok and Triller seem to have a lot in common. These social video apps provide users with an excellent way to showcase their creativity. Both these apps allow you to edit and share videos, have an extensive music library, and allow you to share videos on other social networking apps.</p><p>But, besides the similarities, there are major differences. In fact, with the Trump administration’s concerns over TikTok, many are contemplating Triller vs. TikTok. Even though both the apps offer pretty much similar services, certain features set them apart from each other.</p><p>Here’s a handy comparison outlining the notable differences between TikTok and Triller:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Features</th><th>TikTok</th><th>Triller</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Place Of Origin</td><td>China</td><td>Los Angeles</td></tr><tr><td>Users</td><td>800 million active users, with more than 2 billion downloads</td><td>65 million active users, with more than 250m downloads</td></tr><tr><td>Discover Page</td><td>Trending hashtags, promoted ad campaigns</td><td>Leaderboards, trending hashtags, categorized genre charts, promoted ad campaigns</td></tr><tr><td>Video Duration</td><td>TikTok users can make videos of 15 seconds only</td><td>Triller users can make full music videos to whole tracks</td></tr><tr><td>Video Editing Capabilities</td><td>User-based, ability to add text in particular parts of the clips, range of speeds, effects, overlays, etc.</td><td>A.I.-based, fast motion&#x2F;slow motion, text (basic), overlays</td></tr><tr><td>Music</td><td>Only allows listening to 15-seconds of a song, only lets you use music that is ingested in the app in the videos</td><td>Only allows listen to full songs, can use music that is Triller, Spotify, or Apple Music</td></tr><tr><td>AI Deployment</td><td>Analyzes the users’ preferences and interests through engagement and displays a personalized feed to every user</td><td>Analyzes biometric movements of videos and adapts them to a song’s beat</td></tr><tr><td>Genre</td><td>TikTokers can make videos on any topic, regardless of the genre</td><td>Triller seems to favor EDM and hip-hop</td></tr><tr><td>Sharability</td><td>Can download videos to share to other social networking sites</td><td>Can download videos to share to other social networking sites</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="How-To-Make-Money-On-The-Two-Apps"><a href="#How-To-Make-Money-On-The-Two-Apps" class="headerlink" title="How To Make Money On The Two Apps?"></a>How To Make Money On The Two Apps?</h2><p>Amid Triller vs. TikTok, the hunt for the better social video platform is on. Although TikTok’s fate in the US is still hanging on the balance, its popularity and usage still continue to sky-rocket in other territories.</p><p>Wondering if you should really switch to Triller or stick with TikTok, for now, to show off your brand? Read on for a quick review.</p><p><strong>Triller vs. TikTok: For Marketing Influencers</strong></p><p>TikTok is undoubtedly a better social video platform for marketing influencers worldwide in terms of reach. Wondering why? Well, in comparison to Triller’s 65m, TikTok has 800 million active users. Moreover, unlike Triller that’s available only in 50 countries, TikTok is available in 155 countries. Also, TikTok has successfully launched a generation of influencers who had started as non-celebrities.</p><p><strong>Triller vs. TikTok: For Brand Building</strong></p><p>Leveraging TikTok can be the key to increasing social brand awareness. This is because with TikTok’s audience growing BY every second, you can use the platform to build your brand. Triller also gives brands a great platform for increasing exposure and get a better share of voice on social media. Just like TikTok, Triller is a fun way for brands to promote their products in their video content.</p><p><strong>Triller vs. TikTok: For Advertising</strong></p><p>TikTok provides advertisers with several options to reach their target demographic. When TikTokers open the app, ads appear and take over the screen completely for a few seconds before it turns into an in-feed video ad. From ad creation and targeting to insight reports and ad management tools, TikTok ads offer an easy-to-use and powerful platform for businesses to advertise. On the other hand, Triller doesn’t include ads currently. Instead, it focuses on letting creators raise money from followers and advertisers as well as crowdfund.</p><p><strong>Triller vs. TikTok: For Content Creators</strong></p><p>To choose the better platform between Triller and TikTok, consider asking yourself a few questions like – What kind of content creators are you creating? Do you spend more time in conceptualizing the message of your video? Would you rather simplify the editing process or have greater flexibility in editing?</p><p>While TikTok features a range of editing tools to give content creators the flexibility of creating the content they want, Triller deploys AI to edit videos for the creator. So, with Triller, you can simply let artificial intelligence compile the best clips for creating a quality video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-money-on-triller-tiktok.png"                      alt="Make Money On Triller Tiktok"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>source：<a class="link"   href="http://www.startupnews.fyi/" >www.startupnews.fyi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>At a time when the internet is divided on whether they should abandon TikTok, the Trump administration approved a deal for Walmart and Oracle to acquire stakes in the US operations of TikTok, thus postponing the potential ban that was planned due to the national security concerns regarding the Chinese owned company. So, US-based TikTokers can finally sigh in relief.</p><p>In summary, both TikTok and Triller offer incredible value to their expanding user base. While TikTok specifically appears to cater to all kinds of publishers and creators, Triller is specifically focused on the artists in the music industry. Videos are all about people smiling, dancing, and having a great time. So, instead of being stressed, get creative and have as much fun as possible!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082541/7443" target="_top" id="2082541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-decoding-the-usage-of-pfp-across-social-networks-including-tiktok/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Decoding the Usage of 'PFP' Across Social Networks, Including TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-dont-miss-out-this-weeks-tiktok-trials/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Don't Miss Out This Week’s TikTok Trials</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-pre-upload-best-practices-to-maintain-tiktoks-integrity/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Pre-Upload Best Practices to Maintain TikTok's Integrity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-essential-steps-for-iphone-7-screen-capture-for-2024/"><u>[New] Essential Steps for iPhone 7 Screen Capture for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-chuckling-chapter-the-most-shared-comedic-content-on-tiktok/"><u>[New] In 2024, Chuckling Chapter The Most Shared Comedic Content on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/choosing-the-right-partners-for-a-safer-tiktok-expansion-for-2024/"><u>Choosing the Right Partners for a Safer TikTok Expansion for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/escape-plan-dodge-facebook-lockdowns-effectively/"><u>Escape Plan Dodge Facebook Lockdowns Effectively</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/in-2024-comprehensive-scrutiny-gear-360s-virtual-reality-capability/"><u>In 2024, Comprehensive Scrutiny Gear 360'S Virtual Reality Capability</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/moto-g-stylus-assessment-noteworthy-efficiency-and-reasonable-battery-duration-insights/"><u>Moto G Stylus Assessment: Noteworthy Efficiency and Reasonable Battery Duration Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/solution-reducing-msmpengines-impact-on-your-pcn-windows-11-performance/"><u>Solution: Reducing MsMpEngine's Impact on Your PC'n Windows 11 Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-best-premiere-plans-free-for-pros-for-2024/"><u>Unveiling the Best Premiere Plans, FREE for Pros for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/why-doesnt-apple-join-the-metaverse-wave-like-facebook/"><u>Why Doesn't Apple Join the Metaverse Wave Like Facebook?</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Throughout all of the stages of this process, there are things you can do that can help you attract a broad audience, so let’s take a look at some of the best ways to increase the reach of your videos.</p><h4 id="1-Follow-and-Unfollow-the-Most-Popular-Musers"><a href="#1-Follow-and-Unfollow-the-Most-Popular-Musers" class="headerlink" title="1. Follow and Unfollow the Most Popular Musers"></a>1. Follow and Unfollow the Most Popular Musers</h4><p>This is a simple and effective way to gain the attention of TikTok’s most influential users. Pinpoint the most successful Musers in your niche and follow and unfollow them until they follow you back. Although it may seem silly, this strategy actually works, because, after enough attempts, your favorite members of the platform will look at your profile, and follow you back if they like what they see. Try to comment on their videos, because TikTok stars share on their profiles can potentially increase the chances of being followed back, especially if your comments are always on point. Some of the people whose work you appreciate maybe even willing to share their secrets and help you get more followers.</p><h4 id="2-Make-Your-Profile-Look-Charming"><a href="#2-Make-Your-Profile-Look-Charming" class="headerlink" title="2.

The profile picture, username, or the personal information you provide can all leave a strong impression on people who visit your profile. A long username that is hard to remember isn’t going to help you gain more recognition, mostly because everyone is going to forget it soon after they hear it. Pick a short and catchy username that stands out and try avoiding using different usernames on different social media accounts. Let others know what types of videos they can expect from you by mentioning that you love making fitness videos, vlogs, or simple music videos in which you showcase your singing talents. However, it is also indispensable to be as specific as you can, so besides saying that you’re producing fitness videos, it’s also helpful if you mention that you’re making yoga or aerobics videos. Your profile is the first step to establishing communication with new followers, which is why it is important to do everything you can to encourage others to hit the follow button and start communicating with you.</p><h4 id="3-Participate-in-Viral-Challenges"><a href="#3-Participate-in-Viral-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="3. Participate in Viral Challenges"></a>3. Participate in Viral Challenges</h4><p>Following the latest social media trends is necessary because it enables you to see what other types of content are popular at the moment. Viral challenges, like the recent Kiki challenge, often involve singing and dancing to a popular song, which is why they are a great choice of content for the TikTok platform that is mostly dedicated to music videos. Using trending hashtags in the posts you share on your profile will make your viral challenge videos visible to millions of people, and it can increase your number of followers drastically in just a few days. In addition, a challenge can inspire you to explore a specific topic or a music genre further and help you build an easily recognizable style that can expand the size of your fanbase.</p><h4 id="4-Post-Your-Videos-on-Other-Social-Networks"><a href="#4-Post-Your-Videos-on-Other-Social-Networks" class="headerlink" title="4. Post Your Videos on Other Social Networks"></a>4. Post Your Videos on Other Social Networks</h4><p>Don’t limit yourself to just one social media account because if you do so, you won’t be able to reach the audiences on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. Facebook alone has 2 billion active users each month, while the size of the audience on YouTube isn’t much smaller. Managing accounts on several social networks under the same name is also an effective way to build your online reputation because people will remember the name they saw on one platform. As a result, they will start following you on the other. Posting music and all various types of videos on multiple social media accounts also means that they are going to be shared by a larger number of people.</p><h4 id="5-Don’t-Hesitate-to-Collaborate-with-Others"><a href="#5-Don’t-Hesitate-to-Collaborate-with-Others" class="headerlink" title="5. Don’t Hesitate to Collaborate with Others"></a>5. Don’t Hesitate to Collaborate with Others</h4><p>Being a one-man or a one-woman show doesn’t always pay off, especially if you’re just starting out. Recording a duo with an equally talented friend or making any other type of collab video can have a positive impact on the size of your fanbase. It is important to choose the people you work with carefully because content creators that already have a lot of followers might not be interested in collaborating with you if the number of followers you have is significantly lower than theirs. The people you choose to work with should also share your passion for the type of video you’re hoping to create since there is no point in inviting someone to make a comedy video with you if their main interest is in fashion. After selecting the person, you’re going to collaborate with. You can use the TikTok’s Duet option that offers an easy way to create a music video with someone who shares your taste in music.</p><h4 id="6-Use-Video-Editing-Apps-to-Make-Impressive-Videos"><a href="#6-Use-Video-Editing-Apps-to-Make-Impressive-Videos" class="headerlink" title="6. Use Video Editing Apps to Make Impressive Videos"></a>6. Use Video Editing Apps to Make Impressive Videos</h4><p>All videos, regardless of how short they are, benefit from the video editing process. You don’t have to use professional <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut to edit the videos you share on TikTok, because some other video editing apps offer more eye-catching filters and effects to make a captivating short music video. One of them is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The TikTok app enables you to remove all unwanted parts of the video clips you recorded, and it also features a rich library of visual effects, but it lacks some more advanced video editing options. If you’d like to create the ghost effect or to clone yourself using apps such as Video Star, Triller or MuStar is a much better option, because they offer a wider range of video editing tools than TikTok.

Be Unique and Innovative"></a>7. Be Unique and Innovative</h4><p>Find your own voice, because everyone else’s voice is already taken. If you try to imitate the content other creators produce, you’ll never find your own distinctive style. What’s more, the viewers of your video can easily see if you’re really enjoying making the video or not, and in many cases, that may be the reason why they decide to skip hitting the follow button. Chose topics that you’re passionate about because if you’re just following the trends, the content you produce may seem generic. Don’t be afraid to think out of the box and do something new every once in a while. Just to see how your followers react. More often than not, you’ll discover something your fans adore, and you’ll attract new followers that liked your eagerness to try out new things.</p><h4 id="8-Keep-Things-Short-and-Concise"><a href="#8-Keep-Things-Short-and-Concise" class="headerlink" title="8. Keep Things Short and Concise"></a>8. Keep Things Short and Concise</h4><p>It is not possible to record videos with the TikTok app that last longer than sixty seconds. Therefore, sticking to the one-minute limit is probably the best way to ensure that your followers watch all videos you post on your account from the beginning until the end. There is no time limit for videos you upload to your account, so you can use your phone’s camera app to make videos that are longer than one minute. However, you should tread carefully since the longer duration of a video can discourage viewers from watching the entire video. Producing short music videos can be a challenging task, but it is also a great way to showcase your creativity and inspire others to follow your work.</p><h4 id="9-You’re-Entertainer-Act-Like-One"><a href="#9-You’re-Entertainer-Act-Like-One" class="headerlink" title="9.

Be spontaneous, and enjoy your time in front of the camera. That way you can always keep the spectator guessing what you’re going to do next. Put on a good show, that will leave the viewers of your videos wanting to see more. You can accomplish this by adding a lot of humor to the video or by simply enjoying the moment and going with the flow. Even though there are no recipes to the success of the content you post on the TikTok platform, focusing on your performance while remembering to be funny at times is going to help you increase the number of followers.</p><h4 id="10-Post-New-Content-At-Magic-Hours"><a href="#10-Post-New-Content-At-Magic-Hours" class="headerlink" title="10. Post New Content At Magic Hours"></a>10. Post New Content At Magic Hours</h4><p>Sharing new content at least twice a day will eventually get you a massive following, because it will improve the exposure your videos are getting, but you also have to post videos at the right time. The magic posting hours on TikTok are between 11 am and 5 pm as your followers and their friends are most likely to use the app in that time frame. Get to know your audience and try to understand how frequently and at which hours they’re using the TikTok app. This will help you create a posting schedule that minimizes the chances of posting videos during parts of the day when they get the least amount of exposure.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Be different, be unique, and provide high-quality entertainment to your followers. Try to offer something fresh that will sweep your audience off their feet. The TikTok app features a nearly endless supply of music and video editing options that enable you to express your creativity freely.

Do you use the platform just to watch videos or do you upload your content too? If you said yes to the second part of the question then we are here to make your life easy. Users often spend needlessly extra time and energy when it comes to uploading edited videos on the mobile app of Tiktok.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p>Editing the chosen video on your computer then transferring it to your phone and uploading it to the app is a long and tedious process.

When we talk about ease of use, we refer to the option of directly uploading a video on your TikTok profile from Mac.</p><p>The best thing about TikTok on Mac is that it has made it fairly easy for anyone to use their platform. If you want to upload a video to TikTok on Mac OS you will find it a child’s play. TikTok has a website version of the platform for people to use if they are on their computer.</p><ol><li><p>You should choose a video that has already been editing by video editing software as the website will not allow you to make any edits. We always emphasize using only the best video editor for Mac.</p></li><li><p>Go to Safari and search for the website of TikTok.</p></li><li><p>Once you are on there, you will need to Log in to your account by clicking on the button that appears on the top right corner of the window.</p></li><li><p>After you are in, you need to locate and click on the Cloud icon which will open a window for you to upload your video.</p></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/cloud-icon.jpg"                                     ></p><ol start="5"><li><p>Once the video is uploaded, you will be asked to put in a caption. We advise you to keep the caption quirky and fun. Another quick tip is that you should use hashtags that are trending at the moment as that will increase the visual appearance of your video more.</p></li><li><p>Time to choose a cover! Drag the frame to any part of the video to choose the thumbnail that you want as the cover of your content.</p></li></ol><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/Upload-tiktok-video.jpg"                      alt="Upload tiktok video"                ></p><ol start="7"><li><p>Lastly, choose the audience of the video according to your preference in the same window.</p></li><li><p>Your video is ready to be uploaded and all you need to do now is to click on the Upload button that is on the bottom right of the dialog box.</p></li></ol><h2 id="Methods-of-Uploading-Videos-to-TikTok-on-Windows"><a href="#Methods-of-Uploading-Videos-to-TikTok-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Methods of Uploading Videos to TikTok on Windows"></a>Methods of Uploading Videos to TikTok on Windows</h2><p>As a person who does not own a Mac, you might be wondering if this article is for you or not. From this point onwards, the method will be for people who have a PC. To upload a video to TikTok from a PC, you can follow the same steps as above.</p><p>Believe it or not, the simplest way to upload videos to TikTok on Windows is the one that we have described in detail above. Of course, you will need to remember to edit the videos beforehand with the assistance of Tiktok video editing software.</p><p>If you wish to up your game and follow the best method and not the simplest one then we have something for you. The answer for many TikTok users is an android emulator. It is a sort of an application that behaves like an android device on your PC. It can be downloaded directly on Windows and used from your computer.</p><p>The benefit is that it will allow you to use the application version of TikTok which will allow you to edit the video just like you do on your smartphone.</p><p>You can use any Android emulator but we will advise you to use Bluestacks.

The good news is that two new Snapchat tools have been released – the <strong>Lens Studio</strong> and Create Your Own Lens applications.</p><p>If you are a regular Snapchat user, you may want to learn about the Snapchat lens and how it can help you. We will help you get started. Here is our step by step guide on how to make Snapchat lenses.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: Comparing Lens Studio and Creating Your Own Lens</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: How to Use Lens Studio</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Comparing-Lens-Studio-and-Creating-Your-Own-Lens"><a href="#Part-1-Comparing-Lens-Studio-and-Creating-Your-Own-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Comparing Lens Studio and Creating Your Own Lens"></a>Part 1: Comparing Lens Studio and Creating Your Own Lens</h2><p>The two programs that we are highlighting today are Lens Studio and Create Your Own Lens. These are both fantastic programs for creating your own Snapchat lens, but they do have slightly different uses. If you are the type of person who wants to design a professional Snapchat lens, you are going to prefer Lens Studio.</p><p>But if you are hoping to come up with something creative that you can share with your friends and family, then you may love Create Your Own Lens. It is a very easy program to use, and it offers a ton of features that you may be surprised to see.</p><h4 id="Snapchat-lenses-is-for-fun"><a href="#Snapchat-lenses-is-for-fun" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat lenses is for fun"></a>Snapchat lenses is for fun</h4><p>The beauty of Snapchat lenses is that you can now create your own environment, which you can use each time you are taking photos or videos. Sure, you can always use the filters that are already available in the application, but not everyone would find those enough.</p><p>If you want some customization, or you just want to mess around until you get the filter that makes sense for you, Snapchat lenses are the way to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Lens-Studio.JPG"                      alt="lens studio"                ></p><h4 id="Lens-Studio-is-for-business"><a href="#Lens-Studio-is-for-business" class="headerlink" title="Lens Studio is for business"></a>Lens Studio is for business</h4><p>Lens Studio is perfect for businesses that may want to create unique environments for their clients, or the times when they are releasing company Snapchat posts. Say the company is hosting an event. They may want a custom graphic for that event, which is used for all the pictures and videos posted to Snapchat about the event. Using Lens Studio lets them do that with ease.</p><p>Create Your Own Lens is great when you are going to a special event, birthday party or graduating, and you want a special graphic that comes up in all your snaps. It is very intuitive to use, and is available through the App Store as a download.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/len-studio-snapchat.JPG"                      alt="lens studio snapchat"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-Lens-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-Lens-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use Lens Studio"></a>Part 2: How to Use Lens Studio</h2><h4 id="1-Download-Lens-Studio"><a href="#1-Download-Lens-Studio" class="headerlink" title="1. Download Lens Studio"></a>1. Download Lens Studio</h4><p>The first step involves downloading Lens Studio, which you can do from your computer. It is compatible with both Windows and Mac computers, and will run on any semi-modern system. According to the Snapchat team, Lens Studio is similar to the program used by their AR teams to create lenses. That means you are getting similar functionality, but with an easier to manage interface.</p><h4 id="2-Choose-Templates-Page"><a href="#2-Choose-Templates-Page" class="headerlink" title="2. Choose Templates Page"></a>2. Choose Templates Page</h4><p>It is normal to feel a little overwhelmed the first time you try and use this program. But that is why the templates page is so great. You can select from templates depending on the type of lens that you are hoping to create. You can just use a template, or you can incorporate your own ideas to customize the template.</p><p>There is also a Lens Studio Overview guide that you can access online, which will help you get acquainted with the program’s various features and quirks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lens-studio-templates.JPG"                      alt="lens studio templates"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094480/7443" target="_top" id="2094480">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094480" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094480/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="3-Use-Studio-Panels"><a href="#3-Use-Studio-Panels" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Studio Panels"></a>3. Use Studio Panels</h4><p>Are you ready to create your own custom Snapchat lens? It is time to head over to Studio Panels on the application. This is the area where you can add your own 2D or 3D objects, and you can visualize how they would look as a Snapchat filter. You can add, remove, resize and drag objects to specific areas of the screen.</p><p>There are other tools accessible from the Resources panel. You can use these tools to ensure that your Snapchat lens is exactly as you want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lens-studio-panal.JPG"                      alt="lens studio panel"                ></p><h4 id="4-Preview-the-Snapchat-Lens-You-Create"><a href="#4-Preview-the-Snapchat-Lens-You-Create" class="headerlink" title="4. Preview the Snapchat Lens You Create"></a>4. Preview the Snapchat Lens You Create</h4><p>The great thing about this application is that you can preview the lens before you send it out to your phone. When you are satisfied with the image on the preview, you can pair your phone with the application, and you will be able to send that Snapchat lens onto your phone through your Snapcode. It is that simple!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-snapchat.JPG"                      alt="preview lens studio"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100538/7443" target="_top" id="2100538">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100538" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100538/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-Snapchat-Lenses-Using-Create-Your-Own-Lens"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-Snapchat-Lenses-Using-Create-Your-Own-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens"></a>Part 3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens</h2><ol><li>There are two ways that you can access the tool for creating fun Snapchat lenses. You can either visit the website snapchat.com&#x2F;create, or you can go on the “filters and lenses” section on your iOS device. If you are using Snapchat on an Android device, you will only have the option for the website. But the feature is coming to the Android version of Snapchat very soon.</li><li>When you are in the application or on the website, you may start to look at the different templates for Snapchat lenses. Now you can add other items into the templates, such as photographs, text or graphics.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-snapchat.JPG"                      alt="create snapchat"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006955/19272" target="_top" id="2006955">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006955" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006955/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>It is all up to your imagination. You can create the perfect Snapchat lens, which you can then send into your Snapchat account through your Snapcode. Of course, if you are using your iOS device to create the lens, it is already linked to your account.</p><p>Another cool feature is how you can set the location for where the Snapchat lens is available. Say you are hosting a party. You can have the Snapchat lens available to everyone who uses Snapchat within a set square footage of your home.

There is no two way about the fact that this app is the new kid in town. It is highly popular among the younger generation.</p><p>If you are a new TikToker, you need an introduction video. This has to be engaging enough to attract more and more followers. The primary aim of an introduction video is to say high to your followers and tell them about yourself. With this video, they will get to know you better.</p><p>You May Also Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Upload a Video to TikTok from Mac or PC&gt;&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Section-1-Make-an-Intro-Video-on-TikTok-iPhone"><a href="#Section-1-Make-an-Intro-Video-on-TikTok-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Section 1. Make an Intro Video on TikTok (iPhone)"></a>Section 1. Make an Intro Video on TikTok (iPhone)</h2><p>In case you are all set to create a Tiktok intro video, here are a few tips you need to follow.</p><p>• Including Audio</p><p>At the top of the screen, you will find the option ‘Sound’. This is where you can look through the music. When you are done choosing the song, decide where you would like it to start and play it when you record to sync the shots better. You can also add sound effects and voice-over.</p><p>At present, you can add one song per video inside the app. However, you always have the option to edit the videos using other apps to upload on TikTok.</p><p>In TikTok, you can work with multiple audio layers. For example, you have recorded the clip with in-camera audio, sound effect, music, and anything else you have added. The app will let you lower the camera’s audio volume while raising the music volume.</p><p>• Working with the Text</p><p>For adding title or text to the video, you have to use the Text button. This lets you choose the color, font, and size of the words. If you have used Instagram fonts, this will appear similar. Once you enter the words, choose where you would like to apply them on the screen. You can also set the time and length of the text appearing on the screen.</p><p>• Adding Effects</p><p>Effects are one of the special aspects of TikTok. There are two ways to use them, before or after recording. When you’re done recording the video, you can reverse it, speed it up, or add filters. The app also lets you apply an effect when you are recording.</p><p>Since TikTok videos are mostly viewed on smartphones, vertical orientation is the best option. However, horizontal orientation is also allowed on TikTok. <strong>The best aspect ratio will be 9:16 for TikTok videos</strong> so that they can be viewed properly on any smartphone. Last, but not least, <strong>the dimension has to be 1080 x 1920.</strong></p><h2 id="Section-2-Make-a-TikTok-Intro-Video-on-Mac"><a href="#Section-2-Make-a-TikTok-Intro-Video-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Section 2.

TikTok has a website version of the platform for people to use if they are on their computer.</p><ol><li><p>You should choose a video that has already been editing by video editing software as the website will not allow you to make any edits.

You can do it by visiting the website and downloading the software to your computer. Then locate the <strong>exe. file</strong> you downloaded and double-click on it. Once the installer launches, click on the <strong>Install Now</strong> button. After the installation is completed, click on the <strong>Complete</strong> button.</p><p>Now the BlueStacks emulator is installed on your PC. Launch it and head over to the <strong>App Center</strong> tab. You will be asked to sign in to your Google account.

Once the app appears in the search results, click on it and proceed to click on the <strong>Install</strong> button.

Go to the BlueStacks website and click on the <strong>Download</strong> button to initiate the download process.</p><p>Step 2. Open the folder where the BlueStacks installer is located, find the <strong>installer</strong> <strong>dmg. file</strong>, and then double-click on it.</p><p>Step 3.

Once you sign in with your Google account, you can proceed to install the app on your computer. The steps for installing TikTok on PC and Mac computers are the same, so you just need to find the app in the Google Play Store and click on the <strong>Install</strong> button.

If you know<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-does-chatgpt-work/" >how ChatGPT works <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you’ll know that it isn’t scraping the internet for the latest information about any topic or news. The AI works on older data and doesn’t search the internet. WebChatGPT is an innovative workaround for this problem that adds web search results to ChatGPT.</p><p> Here’s how it works. Once you install the extension and open ChatGPT, you’ll see a bar under the usual dialog box for queries and prompts. Toggle the<strong>Search the Web</strong> button to activate WebChatGPT and select parameters. You can ask it to search for up to 10 results, set how far back it’ll search for links (day, week, month, year), and set a region.</p><p> When you give ChatGPT any prompt, it’ll conduct a web search and gather the results. Then, the extension automatically frames a revised prompt that includes those latest results and your original query, instructing ChatGPT to scan and include the results.</p><p> The final output from the AI thus gives you more up-to-date information, such as news summaries, sports statistics, weather reports and forecasts, and stock market updates.</p><p> You can customize the default revised prompt that WebChatGPT uses, but as a new user, we wouldn’t suggest that. Once you’re more accustomed to using this extension, feel free to look into options that improve your queries</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> WebChatGPT for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-advanced/lpfemeioodjbpieminkklglpmhlngfcn" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-chatgpt/" >Firefox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1484963">                    <video width="864" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1484963.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484963">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1484963.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1484963%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484963/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-ChatGPT-Prompt-Genius"><a href="#2-ChatGPT-Prompt-Genius" class="headerlink" title="2.

But those screenshots don’t show the prompts users have typed to make ChatGPT better. Like<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-google-search-tips-pdf/" >learning the best Google search operators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you need to know how to frame the right prompts for ChatGPT. And this extension can help.</p><p> ChatGPT Prompt Genius is like a cheatsheet for prompts to feed the AI. The extension gathers user-generated prompts for various functions and tasks through a<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/" >Subreddit community <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> With the extension, you can quickly run these in ChatGPT or filter them to browse through categories such as academic writing, business, learning, fun and games, fiction writing, non-fiction writing, programming, social media, speeches, scripts, etc.</p><p> The more you discover and import these prompts and customize them to your needs, the more you’ll learn how to write specific questions that ChatGPT can understand and answer.</p><p> You can curate and save your recently used prompts if you want to reuse them later. The extension lets you save entire chats with the ChatGPT AI as a PDF, PNG, or Markdown HTML file directly from the browser. You can also use custom themes for the chat interface, but that’s more about looks than function.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> ChatGPT Prompt Genius for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-history/jjdnakkfjnnbbckhifcfchagnpofjffo/" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatgpt-history/" >Firefox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="3-ChatGPT-Writer"><a href="#3-ChatGPT-Writer" class="headerlink" title="3.

ChatGPT Writer</h2><p> When someone sends a professional email your way for something like a meeting or a job opportunity, it’s bad form to reply with a one or two-line email (even if that sums up everything you want to say). ChatGPT Writer takes your intended reply and generates a long, professional-sounding email message.</p><p> The extension works with all email services but is specially primed for Gmail, offering a button next to<strong>Send</strong> in the<strong>Compose</strong> message box. When you fire up ChatGPT Writer, you’ll see the original email and find a box to enter what you want to reply briefly.</p><p> You can make it a simple and easy command; for example, “Write a reply to this email about my interest in the job and seek information about salary.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chatgpt-writer-1.jpg"                      alt="an email reply using chatgpt writer"                ></p><p> ChatGPT Writer will take a few seconds and then compose a long, professional message along those lines. You can change or edit any words within the box, or redo your prompt if it’s not satisfactory. When you’re happy with the result, insert it directly into the<strong>Reply</strong> box, and you’re ready to send it.</p><p> The first time you use ChatpGPT Writer, you’ll need to log in to your OpenAI account with it. The extension works with any Chromium browser such as Chrome, Brave, or Edge. While it’s currently best for replying to professional emails, you can also give it non-work prompts to write casual and personal email messages.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> ChatGPT Writer for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-writer-write-mail/pdnenlnelpdomajfejgapbdpmjkfpjkp/" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="4-YouTube-Summary-With-ChatGPT"><a href="#4-YouTube-Summary-With-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="4.

Many times, all you want is a transcript to quickly browse through what the video is going to say so that you can know if it’s worth your time.</p><p> Install YouTube Summary With ChatGPT and go to any video. The right sidebar now has a box for<strong>Transcript &amp; Summary</strong> , clicking which will open a time-stamped transcript of the video generated by ChatGPT.</p><p> Click any timestamp to be taken to that moment in the video. If you’re already midway through the video, you can jump to the current time in the transcript. And you can copy-paste the transcript anywhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/youtube-summary-extension.jpg"                      alt="using the &#39;transcript and summary box&#39; from youtube summary extension"                ></p><p> The extension also has a button to view an AI-generated summary of the video. Clicking this takes you to ChatGPT, with the transcript already typed in the prompt. All you have to do now is prompt ChatGPT to summarize the text, and you’ll get an instant summary.</p><p> You can also add further prompts for more details regarding specific parts of the video without having to watch the full thing.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> YouTube Summary With ChatGPT for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-summary-with-chat/nmmicjeknamkfloonkhhcjmomieiodli" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/glasp-social-web-highlighter/id1605690124" >Safari <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="5-Talk-to-ChatGPT"><a href="#5-Talk-to-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="5.

But Google Chrome offers some excellent voice commands and text-to-speech features. Talk-to-ChatGPT bridges this gap to let you issue prompts by talking to your computer and having the ChatGPT answers read aloud by AI.</p><p> Once you install the extension, refresh the ChatGPT tab once, and press<strong>Start</strong> in the extension to allow access. A floating panel in the top-right of your screen shows whether it’s active or not, and you can toggle it to record, playback audio to read the answers or pause.</p><p> Talk-to-ChatGPT is an open-source extension that lets you fiddle around with the settings. You can choose from different AI voices, the voice pitch, and the speed at which text is read. It also supports voice command shortcuts of “Stop” and “Pause” to control playback.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Talk-to-ChatGPT for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/talk-to-chatgpt/hodadfhfagpiemkeoliaelelfbboamlk" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959707/19272" target="_top" id="1959707">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959707" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959707/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-ChatGPT-for-Search-Engines"><a href="#6-ChatGPT-for-Search-Engines" class="headerlink" title="6.

It also works with Bing, but you don’t need that anymore, given Microsoft has already officially integrated the two.</p><p> You’ll find the AI answers in the right sidebar next to regular search results. The extension can run for every search, for keywords that end with a question mark, or you can trigger it manually when you want to. Clicking the extension icon opens a shortcut to run a ChatGPT query directly through a drop-down panel.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> ChatGPT for Search Engines for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-for-search-engine/feeonheemodpkdckaljcjogdncpiiban/" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatgpt-for-search-engines/" >Firefox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/chatgpt-for-search-engine/pnglghgjhaklojnjpkhcdidgalehmkbn" >Edge <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977032">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977032">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977032%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977032/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Perplexity-AI"><a href="#7-Perplexity-AI" class="headerlink" title="7.

But, like anything in tech, it carries an ugly side to it, too. The rise of fake news and misinformation, for instance, is one of its biggest unwanted by-products.</p><p> Perplexity AI can help you cut the misinformation out. Indeed, as the developers put it, the tool works as a combination of Google and ChatGPT. Simply type in your query in the extension and the tool will summarize you the best possible result—along with the legitimate cited sources. The last part here is very important.</p><p> While the tool summarizes the information in a neat manner, it ends the answers with a quick mention of the best, legitimate sources. And while there’s still a possibility of fault here (you’d still need to rely on the sources that Perplexity provides), we believe it’s much better than going in blind with the usual, source-less responses you’d otherwise gotten from ChatGPT.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Perplexity AI for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perplexity-ai-companion/hlgbcneanomplepojfcnclggenpcoldo" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="ChatGPT-Is-Awesome-But-Be-Realistic…"><a href="#ChatGPT-Is-Awesome-But-Be-Realistic…" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT Is Awesome, But Be Realistic…"></a>ChatGPT Is Awesome, But Be Realistic…</h2><p> With these extensions including search results in ChatGPT, showing you how to use the right prompts, and using AI to improve YouTube or Gmail, you might think it’s time to offload a majority of your work to ChatGPT. But take a breath.</p><p> Yes, the AI capabilities are amazing compared to what has existed before this, but ChatGPT isn’t ready for prime-time yet. It still has a long way to go and depends largely upon the user keying in the right prompts. The data that it bases its answers on can also leave a lot to be desired in certain cases. For now, feel free to use it, but don’t rely wholly on it, and take those results with a pinch of salt.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-deciphering-the-secrets-to-your-personalized-tiktok-code-for-2024/"><u>[New] Deciphering the Secrets to Your Personalized TikTok Code for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-the-latest-tiktok-trends-what-to-observe/"><u>[New] The Latest TikTok Trends What to Observe</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-take-screenshots-on-xbox-one/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved How to Take Screenshots on Xbox One</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-guard-your-images-with-top-photo-watermarks/"><u>2024 Approved Guard Your Images with Top Photo Watermarks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/best-mac-compatible-flip-video-converters-reviewed-unveiling-the-top-picks/"><u>Best Mac-Compatible Flip Video Converters Reviewed: Unveiling the Top Picks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/ending-iphone-quiet-mode-effective-strategies-for-restoring-notifications-sounds/"><u>Ending iPhone Quiet Mode: Effective Strategies for Restoring Notifications Sounds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-achieving-excellence-in-game-recording-techniques-windows-11-style/"><u>In 2024, Achieving Excellence in Game Recording Techniques, Windows 11 Style</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-getting-started-with-computers-the-basics-of-going-live-on-tiktok/"><u>In 2024, Getting Started with Computers The Basics of Going Live on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-scripting-the-final-push-for-your-tiktok-series/"><u>In 2024, Scripting the Final Push for Your TikTok Series</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Anyone can go viral and become TikTok famous by gaining more likes, lots of views, and video shares. TikTok’s algorithm can put your videos at the top of the “For You” scroll and turn you into a sensation overnight, thus skyrocketing your followers count in a matter of few days. But, did you know that TikTok removed almost 50 million videos in just 6 months because those videos violated its rules?</p><p>While this social media site can easily be your shot to fame, it can even take away your audience. Or worse, it can ban you from using the app if you do not follow its community guidelines and rules. And, if you’ve been on TikTok for a while now, chances are you’ve heard about users getting ‘shadowbanned’. It’s not unusual for users to unknowingly stop receiving likes, views, and traffic on their accounts due to <strong>TikTok shadowban</strong>.</p><p>Ever since the influx of social media, shadow banning, also known as ghost banning or stealth banning, has been around. It comes up when content has been blocked or partially blocked. Sadly, when your TikTok account is shadowbanned, it will negatively affect your reach and halt your growth. Influencers and businesses rely on social media to create a community.

Basically, it means your account has been banned. But, the shadow part of the term means that you won’t know about the ban.</p><p>Shadowban on TikTok is a restriction that prevents your videos from appearing on the <strong>For You</strong> page or on hashtag results. It is a situation where your visibility has been reduced or where you have been banned from the platform, without your knowledge.</p><p>The act of shadowbanning a TikTok account is an automatic process done by TikTok’s algorithm to protect other users against spam content, copyright issues, and adult content. When you get shadowbanned, you stop receiving likes, views, and traffic from the For You page. Often, shadowbans go unnoticed until another user who stumbled upon your video points it out.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban"><a href="#Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?"></a>Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?</h2><p>At the early stages of TikTok, shadowbans lasted for 24 hours. But, with the latest update in the TikTok algorithm, the length of TikTok shadowban is growing. Nowadays, a TikTok account is shadowbanned for approximately up to 2 weeks.</p><p>Within the first week, there will be a drop in your followers and so will the views. After a few days of the account shadowban being in place, you won’t be able to enter any tags or make new videos on TikTok unless they are public.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-shadowban.png"                      alt="tiktok shadowban"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?"></a>Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?</h2><p>The TikTok app doesn’t ever actually tell if you are shadowbanned. But, if you are then you can probably notice it. If you are shadowbanned, your videos will neither show up on the TikTok “For You” page nor will they appear when you search them via hashtag.</p><p>During a TikTok shadowban, your videos and content will not:</p><ul><li>be visible in the search results</li><li>be visible on the feed</li><li>receive new followers</li><li>receive likes from others</li><li>receive comments from others</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2112007/7443" target="_top" id="2112007">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2112007" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2112007/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?"></a>Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok has not issued any explanation on its shadowbanning techniques. However, what makes complete sense is that TikTok shadowbans its users for creating videos that violate its community guidelines.</p><p>Any video with offensive content that can harm the sentiments of people or anything that can trigger other users can attract TikTok shadowban. The app might limit the visibility of your content for reasons such as your account acting as spam or you are posting inappropriate content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shadowbanned-on-tiktok.png"                      alt="shadowbanned on tiktok"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049390/7443" target="_top" id="2049390">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049390" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049390/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Spam Behavior</strong></p><p>The primary reason why a user’s TikTok account can get shadowbanned is that they behave like a spammer. Usually, new people go on a spree of liking and following people in the hope that they will like and follow back. However, TikTok might recognize this behavior as spam and consider you as a robot.</p><p>If you like more than 100 posts daily, you might want to slow down. If you follow more than 50 TikTok accounts in a day, it is best to re-evaluate that strategy.</p><p><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong></p><p>Posting videos that go against the TikTok rules and community guidelines can get you shadowbanned or permanently banned.</p><p>The following content is considered inappropriate by TikTok:</p><ul><li>hate speech</li><li>fake news</li><li>violence</li><li>nudity</li><li>drugs</li><li>copyrighted music</li></ul><p>TikTok is committed to make its platform an inclusive and safe space. So, if you have experienced a drop in views or engagement, consider reassessing your recent content.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?"></a>Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?</h2><p>Wondering about how do you get unshadowbanned on TikTok? Here’s what you can do to remove your shadowban:</p><h4 id="Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok"><a href="#Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok"></a>Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok</h4><p>Firstly, delete your recent video. If it doesn’t work, uninstall and then reinstall the TikTok app. Sometimes, your app might just need an update to become functional once again.</p><h4 id="Switch-to-A-Pro-Account"><a href="#Switch-to-A-Pro-Account" class="headerlink" title="Switch to A Pro Account"></a>Switch to A Pro Account</h4><p>When doing a Google search on how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok, the most common tip you’ll find is to go into the Settings of your TikTok account and tap “Switch to a Pro Account”. The reason is that making the switch will allow you to see analytics for your posts and find out how people access your videos. By doing this, you can easily monitor how far your engagement has increased or dropped.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-pro-account.jpg"                      alt="tiktok pro account"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115916/19272" target="_top" id="2115916">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115916" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115916/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Delete-Offensive-Content"><a href="#Delete-Offensive-Content" class="headerlink" title="Delete Offensive Content"></a>Delete Offensive Content</h4><p>You should delete content that goes against the rules and community guidelines laid down by TikTok. After deleting inappropriate content, you have to wait for at least two weeks to get the shadowban lifted. You can refresh your device once in a while to check if you have finally managed to lift the ban.</p><h4 id="Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime"><a href="#Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime" class="headerlink" title="Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime"></a>Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime</h4><p>Once you have deleted offensive content, clear the cache, close your app, ensure it is updated and then take a break from TikTok for a few days. Coming back after you have cleaned up your account and taken the needed break might get you unshadowbanned on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Post-Original-Innovative-Content"><a href="#Post-Original-Innovative-Content" class="headerlink" title="Post Original, Innovative Content"></a>Post Original, Innovative Content</h4><p>When you return to posting content, you need to make sure your TikTok account doesn’t get shadowbanned again. Your account has already been flagged for something and so you need to try even harder to behave. If you go back to posting the same kind of content that got you banned in the first place, you will be booted off the stage again.</p><p>Ensure you always post original content with innovative ideas. Brainstorm new ideas with your team and come up with something new and unique. This way, you can avoid copyright infringement laws on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Know-Your-Audience-More"><a href="#Know-Your-Audience-More" class="headerlink" title="Know Your Audience More"></a>Know Your Audience More</h4><p>These days, there are many kids and minor accounts on TikTok, and maintaining a healthy environment is a part of your responsibility. Keep your videos free from sexualized themes, nudity, pornographic material, and suggestive themes. Remember; posting such content can land you in serious trouble with TikTok shadowban.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528700/16446" target="_top" id="1528700">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528700" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528700/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-6-Use-Excellent-Video-Editors-to-Make-Amazing-TikTok-Videos"><a href="#Part-6-Use-Excellent-Video-Editors-to-Make-Amazing-TikTok-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Use Excellent Video Editors to Make Amazing TikTok Videos"></a>Part 6: Use Excellent Video Editors to Make Amazing TikTok Videos</h2><p>With increasing competition among TikTok users, it is important to use a powerful video editing tool to make your TikTok videos stand out.

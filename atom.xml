    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Top-25-Anime-Visionaries-on-TikTok-Changing-Content-Norms"><a href="#Top-25-Anime-Visionaries-on-TikTok-Changing-Content-Norms" class="headerlink" title="Top 25 Anime Visionaries on TikTok Changing Content Norms"></a>Top 25 Anime Visionaries on TikTok Changing Content Norms</h2><p>TikTok has become an unstoppable source of entertainment. Memes and videos are appealing to watch, although better ones are released virtually every day for inspiration. numerous musicians included as they acquire recognition. Their tunes and hits delighted viewers, and songs earned prominence. Most individuals obtained followers via popular videos that were often featured on the subscribers’ lists. Get inspired by the newest <strong>anime TikTok</strong> trends and discover how to spot upcoming trends to boost your company or personal account.</p><p>Something that appears perennially groovy one moment might be insufferable the next — like, say, wearing fedoras or Kreepa’s <strong>anime TikTok</strong> “Oh No.” Every second, new trend is forming, and old ones are fading. It’s the cycle of life. If you’re seeking inspiration, read on: we’ve put up a guide to the finest TikTok trends of 2022. So how can we stay up with the current TikTok trends? How do we remain hip? A TikTok trend might be music, hashtag, dance, or challenge. Even how you modify your <strong>TikTok anime</strong> might become a trend like a fancy transition style. Once a <strong>TikTok anime</strong> trend begins to gather hold, people “hop on” it by duplicating a current TikTok video or theme.</p><h2 id="Top-20-TikTok-Anime-Idea"><a href="#Top-20-TikTok-Anime-Idea" class="headerlink" title="Top 20 TikTok Anime Idea"></a>Top 20 TikTok Anime Idea</h2><p>Brace yourself for the upcoming listicle. It contains all about TikTok Anime ideas; dances, songs, memes, and filters. Let’s find out one-by-one:</p><h3 id="Let’s-Groove"><a href="#Let’s-Groove" class="headerlink" title="Let’s Groove:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/lets-groove-jojo" >Let’s Groove: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This is another one of those TikTok trends where individuals show off their talents by dancing to trendy songs or music, which in this instance is a song called “Lets Groove” by an American band named “Earth Wind &amp; Fire“. This trend began when TikToker @absolutesnacc used a remix of Lets Groove to build a fan edit montage incorporating footage of actor Jason Segel from the TV program named “Freaks and Geeks”.</p><h3 id="Trending-dances"><a href="#Trending-dances" class="headerlink" title="Trending dances:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/anime-dance?lang=en" >Trending dances: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>TikTok is recognized for artists who know their movements — and in reality, many of the highest-earning TikTokers are dancers. But due to trendy dances, you don’t have to be an expert to perform the correct choreography. TikTok dances are generally short, pleasant, and entry-level, so amateurs may learn them with minimal effort. This offers a lot of flexibility for putting your twist on it—for example, ripping up the floor in a giant teddy bear costume.</p><h3 id="Prada-Bucket-challenge"><a href="#Prada-Bucket-challenge" class="headerlink" title="Prada Bucket challenge:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/prada-challenge?lang=en" >Prada Bucket challenge: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This TikTok fad is particular to the richer portion of the community, as artists join in this challenge to flaunt their costly attire when sporting a 600$ Prada Bucket hat, thus the name “Prada Bucket challenge”. Participants start by pretending to be “upset” about something, so they put their Prada Bucket hats on, and with some film editing magic, their clothing converts into more costly clothes.</p><h3 id="Glow-ups"><a href="#Glow-ups" class="headerlink" title="Glow-ups:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/biggest-anime-glow-ups?lang=en" >Glow-ups: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>At its essence, a glow-up on TikTok is a “before” and “after.” Many artists may submit a few photographs or films depicting themselves as an awkward adolescent, then a last, contemporary clip. Glow-ups also work excellent for encouraging positive interaction. (Usually, one when they appear confident and amazing). These sorts of TikToks are wonderful for the wait-for-it factor: consumers are more willing to watch the complete video to see the finished product.</p><h3 id="Anime-Edits"><a href="#Anime-Edits" class="headerlink" title="Anime Edits:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/edits-anime?lang=en" >Anime Edits: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>If you’re an anime geek you’ve probably already heard about this trend when producers build a montage utilizing clips from their favorite anime series and add some background music simply to liven things up. Although this trend has been going on for a long now, it still doesn’t seem old since the anime fans have been keeping it alive. So, it doesn’t matter whether you enjoy Initial D or Naruto, this trend is relevant to all anime viewers.</p><h3 id="Edgy-humor"><a href="#Edgy-humor" class="headerlink" title="Edgy humor:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/edgy-humor" >Edgy humor: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>There’s a reason why TikTok is so popular with the under-30 crowd: the brief videos and highly scrollable characteristics of the app make it excellent for comedy, snark, and sass. And although many content producers and skilled social media marketers have discovered ways to convert TikTok into a business, the platform’s core aim is to “inspire creativity and generate joy.” So don’t take it too seriously. The edgier, the better.</p><h3 id="Making-TikToks-with-Your-Family"><a href="#Making-TikToks-with-Your-Family" class="headerlink" title="Making TikToks with Your Family:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Making-an-anime-family" >Making TikToks with Your Family: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This goes hand in hand with being vulnerable and genuine—there’s nothing quite like a nice cameo from Mom, Dad, Grandma, or Grandpa. Because so many TikTok producers are millennials or Gen Z, it’s refreshing (and enjoyable) to see older folks on the platform. The difficult part of this is encouraging your family to join, but if you’ve got one excellent sport, you’ve hit gold. For example, simply try to watch this family dancing blooper without your heartbreak.</p><h3 id="Baked-Feta-Pasta"><a href="#Baked-Feta-Pasta" class="headerlink" title="Baked Feta Pasta:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Baked-Feta-Pasta" >Baked Feta Pasta: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This is a TikTok trend for all those foodies out there who enjoy delicious spaghetti with some cheese. This practice grew so prevalent that the grocery shops in Finland faced a scarcity of feta cheese. The technique of creating this pasta is straightforward, start by adding some cherry tomatoes and garlic in an oven-safe dish, sprinkle some salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning, and pour some olive oil before combining the ingredients. Place a block of Feta cheese in the middle and bake in the oven until soft, compress the contents to make a paste, and combine with your favorite Pasta, that’s it! Your Baked Feta Pasta is ready to be served.</p><h3 id="Seamless-Transitions"><a href="#Seamless-Transitions" class="headerlink" title="Seamless Transitions:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/anime-smooth-transitions" >Seamless Transitions: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Another aspect that’s unique to TikTok is the transitions inside movies. The in-app editing tools make it simple to flip from one clip to another in a manner that appears like magic. This might be as basic as keeping your illumination the same and maintaining your camera in the same location. They may also be more sophisticated. Think spinning your camera about, putting your phone on the ground, zooming in and out – honestly, the sky’s the limit. When someone truly nails a transition, it’s virtually hard to view the video just once.</p><h3 id="Pet-Painting"><a href="#Pet-Painting" class="headerlink" title="Pet Painting:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/pet-painting?lang=en" >Pet Painting: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This TikTok craze is a wonderful way to have your fuzzy companion included in one of your videos. No, you don’t paint a portrait of your pet, your pet performs the painting portion, how you may ask? it’s fairly easy, all you need is a canvas, some liquid colors of your choosing, a huge plastic bag, and a pet, of course, you will also need a paste-like food that your pet enjoys, peanut butter for instance. Start by covering the canvas with the plastic bag and spread peanut butter on the section covering the canvas, gently remove the canvas from the bag and keep the plastic aside.</p><h3 id="Referencing-Modern-Pop-Culture"><a href="#Referencing-Modern-Pop-Culture" class="headerlink" title="Referencing Modern Pop Culture:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/anime-references?lang=en" >Referencing Modern Pop Culture: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Score some likes, comments, and shares by tapping into an already-huge fan following. Trending TV series and movies frequently inspire their TikTok trends. When Squid Game dominated the globe in 2021, it prompted suspense-making instructions, musical mashups, and many tracksuits. This is just one of the millions of instances of how inventive TikTok fans addressed the program.</p><h3 id="Satisfying-Videos"><a href="#Satisfying-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Satisfying Videos:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/satisfying-anime-cooking?lang=en" >Satisfying Videos: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This simply possibly be the most widely accepted and least contentious genre ever: the enjoyable video. Like the day-in-the-life films, they are a celebration of the commonplace. So, the likelihood is, you’re already doing something pleasurable to watch. Whether its soap cutting or cake frosting or freezing bubbles, there’s something very relaxing and fulfilling about this type of material.</p><h3 id="Passing-the-Phone"><a href="#Passing-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Passing the Phone:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/pass-the-phone-challenge?lang=en" >Passing the Phone: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>We’re going to top things off with another TikTok trend, this one is a fun way of roasting your friends or family members and, of course, getting them involved in your TikToks. The way these trend works is really simple, you just call out your friend by making funny comments about certain bad habits or characteristics they have and then pass the phone to them because it’s their turn to do the same, so it’s just a series of taking turns roasting your friends and the best part is that there is no limit to how many people can participate.</p><h3 id="Challenge-Freezing-Honey"><a href="#Challenge-Freezing-Honey" class="headerlink" title="Challenge: Freezing Honey"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Frozen-honey?lang=en" >Challenge: Freezing Honey <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Another TikTok food craze is gaining traction, and it’s safe to assume that Honey is involved. One of the easiest fads to adopt is the freezing honey TikTok craze; everyone has honey and, of course, a freezer. This challenge calls for 100 percent pure honey, since non-pure honey may crystallize at low temperatures. If your honey comes in a plastic bottle, chuck it in the freezer; if it comes in a jar, pour it into a plastic container and remove any lids or bottle tops before freezing, since these may be difficult to remove after freezing.</p><h3 id="Documenting-a-Day-in-The-Life"><a href="#Documenting-a-Day-in-The-Life" class="headerlink" title="Documenting a Day in The Life:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Documenting-Life" >Documenting a Day in The Life: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>While grumpy Instagram users may tell you that “no one wants to see your avocado toast,” the truth is that a lot of people do. Many of these films romanticize the mundane, but humor has a place in this medium as well. If you’re a creative who gets a lot of questions in the comments section, here is the place to be. Seeing someone’s daily routine, whether it’s a second-grade teacher, a lawyer, or a couple living in a van, is a rewarding experience. Over 2 million people have liked this “actual day in the life of a vehicle.”</p><h3 id="Classical-Challenges"><a href="#Classical-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="Classical Challenges:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/anime-tiktok-challenge?lang=en" >Classical Challenges: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>TikTok thrives on obstacles. For challenges, many TikTok users would all post films aiming to achieve the same thing, like the stair-step challenge, where they would dance up a set of steps in intricate ways. These are generally community-created trends; however, they may take the shape of sponsored hashtags, too. Challenges are a simple way for users on TikTok to feel like they’re part of the community.</p><h3 id="Tell-Me-Without-Telling-Me"><a href="#Tell-Me-Without-Telling-Me" class="headerlink" title="Tell Me Without Telling Me:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tellmewithouttellingme?lang=en" >Tell Me Without Telling Me: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>The creator begins by saying, “Tell me you drive a fast car without telling me you drive a fast car” and then says, “I’ll go first” to start a streak for other users to follow. Users then proceed to show the engine layout of their vehicle, the exhaust note, or possibly a flyby, so following this trend is a good way to make your TikToks stand out. This TikTok craze is a wonderful way to tell your audience what you’re trying to say or to depict certain occurrences subtly.</p><h3 id="Behind-the-scenes-Videos"><a href="#Behind-the-scenes-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Behind-the-scenes Videos:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/behind-the-scenes-naruto" >Behind-the-scenes Videos: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>We love an inside scoop, and behind-the-scenes films are perfect for teaching and for making viewers feel like they’re receiving something special. If you’re a creative who generates something tangible (like art, cuisine, or fashion) and advertises it on TikTok, a behind-the-scenes film might give your brand an added depth. You can even produce a behind-the-scenes TikTok describing how you made a TikTok. Ontario, California-based Logan’s candies attracted five and a half million followers by releasing TikToks depicting how their sweets were made—it’s a very interesting process.</p><h3 id="Love-Nwantiti-Dance"><a href="#Love-Nwantiti-Dance" class="headerlink" title="Love Nwantiti Dance:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/nwantiti-anime?lang=en" >Love Nwantiti Dance: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>The Love Nwantiti Dance is a dance that is performed by people who love one another.

Another aspect is that no one else can add content to the private stories you post on Snapchat.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Private-Story-on-Snapchat"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Private-Story-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Private Story on Snapchat?"></a>How to Create a Private Story on Snapchat?</h2><p>To begin how to make a private story on Snapchat, here are the steps to follow:</p><ul><li><a href="#part5">1.Log into Your Account.</a></li><li><a href="#part6">2.Visit Your Profile Page</a></li><li><a href="#part7">3.Select the Private Story option</a></li><li><a href="#part8">4.Create the Story</a></li><li><a href="#part9">5.Share with Your Select Friends</a></li></ul><h4 id="1-Log-into-Your-Account"><a href="#1-Log-into-Your-Account" class="headerlink" title="1.Log into Your Account"></a>1.Log into Your Account</h4><p>Start by logging in to your Snapchat account.

You can use someone else’s account to check if their stories are showing on their feed. You could also send a private snap to that person. If he or she answers the same quickly and yet, you do not get to see their stories that would mean that you are hidden contact in their list.</p><p>You could also ask a common friend if they have even received stories and updates from that person. If the person’s stories are reaching others but not you, that means that they have hidden their stories from you.</p><p><strong>Can You Hide Someone on Snapchat Without Them Knowing?</strong></p><p>If you wish to hide someone but in a way that they do not find out, try the new muting function. This allows you to mute certain friends without them realizing the same. The feature is called ‘Do Not Disturb’ and it allows you to mute conversations that are one on one or come from groups. The feature is a new addition and is a useful one. You need not hide or block any contact in this case but simply silence notifications of their updates.</p><p>To use this feature, all you need to do is tap on the group or the person you wish to silence. The popup menu would include ‘Settings’ and here you can select the option ‘Do Not Disturb’. You will not receive notifications from such conversations. However, you will still be able to access, check messages from such contacts as well as share your stories as well.</p><p>This feature is a useful addition and you need not hide or block a contact to silence conversations from them. Hence, those people will also not get notified unlike when you block a contact. It allows you to see updates from them at your ease and convenience.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Snapchat is an attractive platform to get your daily moments the attention they deserve. You can create stories, private or with anyone else, and share them with selective people of your choice. The Snapchat private story option is great to keep your moments between your close friends or loved ones. Other features such as ‘Do Not Disturb’ allow you to silence notifications from friends or groups that you wish to check as per your convenience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130874/7443" target="_top" id="2130874">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130874" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130874/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-proactive-copyright-verification-for-your-tiktok-videos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Proactive Copyright Verification for Your TikTok Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-fostering-connection-through-respectful-engagement/"><u>[New] Fostering Connection Through Respectful Engagement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-obs-vs-streamlabs-the-ultimate-guide-for-live-streamers/"><u>[New] In 2024, OBS Vs.

This trend started on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and has spread to other social media like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >TikTok <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. TikTok has already conquered the Asian market, but in recent years this video-sharing and social networking app is becoming popular across the globe.</p><p>Standing out from TikTok isn’t as easy as you thought, because you will face fierce competition, and you must do everything you can to improve the quality of the content you share on TikTok. So, in this article, we will look at the best TikTok video editing apps that will enable you to produce content that attracts millions of viewers.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-the-TikTok’s-Built-in-Video-Editing-Tools"><a href="#How-to-Use-the-TikTok’s-Built-in-Video-Editing-Tools" class="headerlink" title="How to Use the TikTok’s Built-in Video Editing Tools"></a>How to Use the TikTok’s Built-in Video Editing Tools</h2><p>In addition to viewing the content posted by other TikTok users, the app lets you record and edit videos. The video editing tools you are going to have at your disposal are basic but still powerful enough to enable you to enhance the 15 and 60-second videos you capture with TikTok.</p><p>To start making a new video, you have to tap on the + icon that is located at the bottom of the app’s home screen and then tap on the red Video button on the app’s Shooting page. Before you start recording, tap on the Add a Sound option if you would like to choose a song or an audio effect you would like to add to a video you’re creating.</p><p>Adding Texts in TikTok Video with TikTok: By Rhia</p><p>Moreover, the app lets you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >control the video’s playback speed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, apply filters and effects or activate the Beauty mode before you start shooting. As we already noted, a video you record with TikTok cannot be longer than 60 seconds. Hence, after you capture your comedy sketch or create a music video, you’ll be able to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >apply stickers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, voice or sound effects, filters, and visual effects or add <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >text layers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Each video you create with TikTok is different, which means that you have to try out different options in order to get the most out of the footage you record with this app. In addition, you can trim videos that are longer than 15 seconds and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >adjust the volume <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of a video’s original sound or the volume of its soundtrack.</p><p>The set of video and audio editing tools TikTok app provides can limit your options during the video editing process, but you can easily solve this issue by tapping on the Upload button that is located in the bottom right corner of the Shooting page.</p><p>This option enables you to use a video editing app that offers more advanced video editing tools to polish your videos before you upload them to TikTok. Once you are done editing, you can proceed to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add the description of the video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and choose if you want to enable comments, reactions, or give your followers the option to create duets.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135372/19272" target="_top" id="2135372">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135372" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135372/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Creating-TikTok-Videos"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Creating-TikTok-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Apps for Creating TikTok Videos"></a>Best Video Editing Apps for Creating TikTok Videos</h2><p>The video editing options TikTok offers are not versatile enough to allow you to perform complex video editing tasks.

For the rest of the specs check out the table below.</p><p> Swipe to scroll horizontally</p><table><thead><tr><th>Processor</th><th>AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX Processor, 16C&#x2F;32T (64M Cache, up to 5.4 GHz)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>GPU</td><td>AMD Radeon RX 7600M XT (GDDR6 8G)</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>DDR5-5200 Dual channel (SODIMM Slots×2, Max 96GB)</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>M.2 2280 PCIe5.0 SSD ×1</td></tr><tr><td>Storage Expansion</td><td>M.2 2280 PCIe4.0 SSD ×1</td></tr><tr><td>Wireless Connectivity</td><td>M.2 2230 Wi-Fi support (Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4)</td></tr><tr><td>Video Output</td><td>HDMI 2.1 ×1；DisplayPort 2.0 ×1；USB-C ×1</td></tr><tr><td>Audio Output</td><td>HDMI 2.1 ×1；DisplayPort 2.0 ×1；3.5mm Combo Jack ×1；Line out ×1</td></tr><tr><td>Peripherals Interface</td><td>RJ45 2.5G Ethernet Port×1 USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A Port ×1(In Front) USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A Port ×3(In Back) USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-C Port ×1(In Front, Data Only) USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-C Port ×1(In Back, Alt Data and DP) HDMI ×1 DisplayPort ×1 3.5mm Combo Jack ×1 Line out ×1 Mic in ×1 Clear CMOS ×1</td></tr><tr><td>Power</td><td>DC 19V (adapter included)</td></tr><tr><td>System</td><td>Windows 11</td></tr></tbody></table><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BCXcTW8u5XFwpHJ2k5ueD6-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan G7 Pt"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p> The AMD Dragon Range CPU and RX7600M XT may not be the newest or most powerful AMD combo a PC maker could assemble in mid-2024. Nevertheless, they should do a pretty good job delivering a capable mini gaming system experience, as long as user ambitions for higher resolutions (like 4K) and raytracing are kept in check.</p><p> Another thing that needs to be carefully kept in check in a mini system is cooling. Minisforum touts the capabilities of its Cold Wave Ultra cooling system, which uses “a vertical single heat pipe with dual air inlets in series and dual-sided quad fans.” Complementing the processor cooling, it has also fitted “an enhanced DDR&#x2F;SSD active cooler and dual liquid metal 8-heat pipe separated link.” The firm claims the cooling fitted into the AtomMan G7 Pt can cope with up to 205W, without fan noise breaching 45dB.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> Other aspects of the interior specs worth commenting on are the device’s easy upgrades with twin DDR5-5200 SODOMM slots for up to 96GB RAM. Also, it has two M.2 storage slots (PCIe5.0 and PCIe4.0), and a socketed wireless card.</p><p> Connectivity seems pretty good for such a small box. As well as Wi-Fi 7 there is a 2.5G Ethernet port, and you can connect up to three 4K monitors at once (HDMI, DP, and USB-C). Six USB ports are available in total, with all being USB 3.2 Gen2 rated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5vH5yUKbtEt5tHuJMtPYk5-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan G7 Pt"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p> One of the bigger changes we have seen added to the AtomMan G7 Pt since its name was switched from the HX200G is the provision of dual RGB backlighting panels. The example logo scrawl provides a prime example of beauty being in the eye of the beholder.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p> Pricing for the AtomMan G7 Pt hasn’t been divulged, though we have written back to Minisforum for some pricing details.

It is a Japanese manga series that got a lot of fame recently. A massive fan of anime might recognize the anime series for its intriguing fight sequences. Recently we have seen a huge trend of Jujutsu Kaisen videos on TikTok where she says “Anime is Trash,” and suddenly the scene turns into an anime fight scene. Technically, this is the filming term “jump cut.” You would likely want to create your own of these videos after watching them.</p><p>If you are one of the Jujutsu Kaisen fans and looking to create your TikTok montage, then you just landed on the right page. You can easily make such videos by using a video editor like Filmora X. In this article, we will walk through the steps involved in creating Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok montage videos. Now you can create your own scenes and connect them with Jutusu Kaisen fight scenes. Trust me, this is so much fun while editing it.</p><h2 id="Step-By-Step-Guide-For-Creating-Jujutsu-Kaisen-TikTok-Videos"><a href="#Step-By-Step-Guide-For-Creating-Jujutsu-Kaisen-TikTok-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Step By Step Guide For Creating Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok Videos"></a><strong>Step By Step Guide For Creating Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok Videos</strong></h2><p>It requires two things to produce such videos. First, you need an idea for making the first part of the video, where you are engaged in some type of activity, or the video involves some kind of interaction with others. Second, you need a clip from the anime that goes along with the first part of the video and justifies the action you perform in the first part of the video. You can create these videos in three simple steps.</p><hr><hr><h4 id="Step1-Download-The-Anime-Clip-From-the-Internet"><a href="#Step1-Download-The-Anime-Clip-From-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Step1: Download The Anime Clip From the Internet"></a>Step1: Download The Anime Clip From the Internet</h4><p>The first thing you need is the anime footage that you want to use in your video. There are plenty of scenes that you can create, but you have to choose wisely. You can search on the internet, and you will find plenty of websites from where you can download these anime videos. The best exercise for selecting the video clip is, keep watching videos and if you find something interesting, download that clip.</p><h4 id="Step2-Shoot-Your-Own-Clip"><a href="#Step2-Shoot-Your-Own-Clip" class="headerlink" title="Step2: Shoot Your Own Clip"></a>Step2: Shoot Your Own Clip</h4><p>Once you have selected a clip from the anime series, you have to make your own video that matches the scene you selected from the anime video. If there are two characters in anime, then you may also need two characters to make your own video. In TikTok videos, you may have seen two characters with a girl saying “Anime is trash” and a boy punching her, and then abruptly, the scene changes to Jujutsu Kaisen fight scene.</p><p>The punching scene is just an example, but you can come up with your own creative scenes that you can connect with anime clips and make interesting videos. Make sure to keep some points in your mind when shooting video,</p><ul><li>Keep the camera stable and make sure there are no shakes in your video. You can use a tripod for this purpose or fix your camera somewhere to keep it stable. Avoid recording video by holding the camera in your hand.</li><li>The video angle should be correct, and it should be according to the anime footage. For example, if the punching person is on the right side of anime footage, you should follow the same sequence.</li><li>It is recommended that the video be shot in sufficient natural light, but artificial lights may also be used.</li><li>It is crucial to use a high-quality camera when making videos. You can do this with a smartphone or camera, and you should make sure you are filming in 1080p. Low-quality video will not perform well.</li></ul><h4 id="Step3-Edit-and-Connect-both-Clips"><a href="#Step3-Edit-and-Connect-both-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Step3: Edit and Connect both Clips"></a>Step3: Edit and Connect both Clips</h4><p>Once you have both video clips, the next step is editing the video and joining them to create a fantastic scene. For this purpose, we will use the Filmora X video editing software, which is both easy to use and one of the best video editing programs. To edit your videos, follow the steps given below:</p><ol><li>Download Filmora X video editor from their official website, install it on your computer if it is already installed, and then run the program to start video editing.</li><li>Go to file, and click on import media and then click on import media files.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu1.png"                      alt="jujutsu1"                ></li><li>Now select both clips and import them to Filmora X.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu2.png"                      alt="jujutsu2"                ></li><li>Drag and drop your own video and bring it to the first track. Then drag and drop the anime video and place it next to your video in the track.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu3.png"                      alt="jujutsu3"                ></li><li>You may need to make some adjustments to both video clips so that the scenes perfectly match each other. The most important step in creating videos matches the sound where a person says, “Anime is trash,” and then the action happens.</li><li>Play the video to make sure everything is in position. If you feel that it still requires adjusting, then go back to the previous step and make the needed adjustments.</li><li>Music is critical to match to make the video looks smooth. Find your music to make them fit perfectly. For example, matching the hard beat with the punch or turning up the volume when the anime shows would be good ideas.</li><li>Once everything is perfectly aligned, your video is ready, and now you need to export it.</li><li>Click on the export button and select the desired video format from the list, i.e. (MP4, Gif, WMV, FLV, etc.).<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu4.png"                      alt="jujutsu4"                ></li><li>Once you have selected the desired format, click on export, and the video will take some time to render. Once rendered, you can now share the video with your friends and wow them. <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu5.gif"                      alt="jujutsu5"                ></li></ol><p>Conclusion: These are some simple steps using which you can create your own Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok Montage. Now it’s up to you to create new ideas and make interesting videos. We recommend using the Filmora X video editor because it is easy to use and can do wonders for you. Even if you don’t have any prior experience in video editing, you can follow these steps and create amazing videos. It may take some time, but you will get better eventually.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload

A mix of lip sync videos, music, and micro-video content, TikTok is extremely popular with Gen Z. Over the years, TikTok has continued to enhance the user experience by adding new features, effects, and guidelines.</p><p>Text-to-speech is one of the newest features to be added to the popular platform and it provides an additional way to add something innovative to the video uploads. Announced in December 2020, <strong>text to speech on TikTok</strong> lets creators put their text over their videos and have a Siri-like voice read it out loud.</p><p>TikTok’s text-to-speech feature was added to make the platform accessible to more people by providing an easy way for text to be heard as well as read. Consequently, using this option in video creation is one way that content creators can ensure their videos appeal to a larger number of viewers, while also offering a more comprehensive experience in general.</p><p>Since its launch, the feature has been going viral. Many find the automated voice to be a selling point in itself and something that adds a different element to the content. Also, it is a great way to get a message across without actually speaking during the video. No matter the reason it is used, the fact that many are turning to text-to-speech makes it a great addition to TikTok.</p><p>Wondering how to get the text to speech on TikTok for your next video? Here’s a detailed insight into this new feature.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Customize the Text-To-Speech Voice On TikTok?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-Text-To-Speech-Feature-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-Text-To-Speech-Feature-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?"></a>Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?</h2><p>In December 2020, TikTok began rolling out a new text-to-speech feature that automatically turns text into a voiceover as users watch videos that have the feature enabled. The popular social media platform included the new option as an accessibility feature for users with impaired vision, a growing trend for apps integrating voice technology.</p><p>Simply put, text to speech on TikTok allows video content creators to convert any piece of text they put on top of their video into a Siri-sounding voice. This means that whatever you type will be read out loud in a robotic tone, eliminating the need for you to narrate. It is a useful way to explain your videos to add context, describe what’s happening, or serve the purpose you see fit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/text-to-speech-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="text-to-speech tiktok"                ></p><p>Source: dexerto.com</p><p>There are numerous reasons why you might decide to use this option. Firstly, it’s a great alternative for users who can’t or don’t want to use their own voice in videos. Perhaps you’re shy or just wish to keep an air of anonymity. Or, you might have a speech impediment, or communicate non-vocally or non-verbally. Either way, this feature offers a great alternative way to narrate to viewers.</p><p>Also, there are several benefits this feature provides to the audience. Some of your viewers may have poor eye-sight, might struggle to read, or are blind. Using text to speech on TikTok will help you make sure that they can still interact with your video.</p><p>Making your video more accessible means that you will get better engagement, which is a win-win situation for you. Lastly, many TikTokers use the text-to-speech option for comedic or dramatic effects.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880960/19272" target="_top" id="1880960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880960/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-Happened-to-TikTok-Text-To-Speech"><a href="#Part-2-What-Happened-to-TikTok-Text-To-Speech" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?"></a>Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?</h2><p>Recently, TikTok changed the voice on its text-to-speech feature to a new, more energetic, and upbeat voice. This is because of a lawsuit filed by professional voice actor Beverley Standing against ByteDance – the parent company of TikTok. Standing had sued ByteDance in mid-May for using her voice in the text-to-speech setting without her permission.</p><p>The lawsuit of the voice actor states that she was hired to work in 2018 for the state-backed Chinese Institute Of Acoustics research body to use in translations and that TikTok has used them without paying her and it has caused damage. She said she hadn’t authorized the use of her voice beyond the use for translations.</p><p>The lawsuit concerns the English-language voice used in North America. TikTok videos made prior to the change still feature the old tone. Although TikTok is yet to comment on the new voice or Standing’s lawsuit, the timing of the changes is very suggestive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139111/17108" target="_top" id="2139111">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139111" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139111/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Text-To-Speech-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Text-To-Speech-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?"></a>Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?</h2><p>Are you puzzled about how to get text to speech on TikTok? Check out the step-by-step guide below without any further ado!</p><h4 id="Step-1-Update-Your-TikTok-to-The-Latest-Version"><a href="#Step-1-Update-Your-TikTok-to-The-Latest-Version" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Update Your TikTok to The Latest Version"></a>Step 1: Update Your TikTok to The Latest Version</h4><p>First things first, ensure your TikTok is updated to the latest version so that you have the TikTok text-to-speech function. Many people have the natural human tendency to push updates as far as technologically possible. But, if you are perplexed about how to do text to speech on TikTok, ensure you have the latest version of this social media app before anything else.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/latest-version-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="latest version tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Start-Recording-a-Video"><a href="#Step-2-Start-Recording-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Start Recording a Video"></a>Step 2: Start Recording a Video</h4><p>Take into account what you wish to say beforehand and have a rough idea of how quickly you want it to be read as the text to speech entry can be as long as your video. After you have the video recording you want to add the text over, press the checkmark on the lower right-hand corner of your app’s screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/start-record-video-tiktok.jpeg"                      alt="start-record video tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-3-Enter-Your-Text"><a href="#Step-3-Enter-Your-Text" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Enter Your Text"></a>Step 3: Enter Your Text</h4><p>Next, tap the text icon at the bottom of your screen and type the text you’d like to be read aloud. Ensure you keep in mind the length. Once you have entered the text, tap ‘<strong>Done</strong>’ in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. This will insert a customizable text box over your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/enter-text-tiktok.png"                      alt="enter text tiktok"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1885932/19272" target="_top" id="1885932">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1885932" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1885932/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Step-4-Tap-On-the-Text-Choose-Text-To-Speech"><a href="#Step-4-Tap-On-the-Text-Choose-Text-To-Speech" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Tap On the Text, Choose Text-To-Speech"></a>Step 4: Tap On the Text, Choose Text-To-Speech</h4><p>When it comes to using text to speech on TikTok, this is another crucial step.Once you enter the text into the TikTok video, tap the Textbox and you will have three options: Text-to-Speech, Set Duration, and Edit. Select Text-to-Speech and the inbuilt text-to-speech AI of TikTok will read your text over the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tap-text-to-speech-tiktok.png"                      alt="tap-text-to speech tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-5-Save-the-Video-Locally"><a href="#Step-5-Save-the-Video-Locally" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Save the Video Locally"></a>Step 5: Save the Video Locally</h4><p>It is here that you will venture outside TikTok to change the text-to-speech voice. Once your video is ready in every other way, consider saving it locally on your device and not post it for everyone to see. Ensure the “<strong>Save to Device</strong>” option is active and you can post it privately.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/save-to-device-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="save-to device tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-6-Download-A-Video-Editor-with-Voice-Modifiers"><a href="#Step-6-Download-A-Video-Editor-with-Voice-Modifiers" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Download A Video Editor with Voice Modifiers"></a>Step 6: Download A Video Editor with Voice Modifiers</h4><p>Next, you have to download a video editor – ideally for your smartphone – with voice modifiers. Adding ‘video’ into the search keywords alongside ‘Voice Modifier’ or ‘Voice Changer’ will bring up a list of options. Remember; many voice changers or free editors will either block the option to save edited videos onto the device behind a paywall or leave a watermark.</p><h4 id="Step-7-Edit-the-Video-and-Resave"><a href="#Step-7-Edit-the-Video-and-Resave" class="headerlink" title="Step 7: Edit the Video and Resave"></a>Step 7: Edit the Video and Resave</h4><p>Once you have chosen your video editor, launch it and import your saved TikTok video. Here, you can edit the audio just like any other video, and voice modifiers can be applied if the video editing tool you choose has them. Apply different effects you’d like and resave your new and modified TikTok video to your device.</p><h4 id="Step-8-Upload-as-A-New-Video-to-TikTok"><a href="#Step-8-Upload-as-A-New-Video-to-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Step 8: Upload as A New Video to TikTok"></a>Step 8: Upload as A New Video to TikTok</h4><p>Open the TikTok app and upload the new, edited TikTok as a singular video directly, without any further edits. You will get a TikTok video with a customized text-to-speech voice for all intents and purposes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-video-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="upload video tiktok"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Customize-the-Text-To-Speech-Voice-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Customize-the-Text-To-Speech-Voice-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Customize the Text-To-Speech Voice On TikTok?"></a>Part 4: How to Customize the Text-To-Speech Voice On TikTok?</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the powerful and easy-to-use video editing software that lets content creators empower the story and be amazed at results, no matter the skill level.

So, what’s the use of these tools?</p><p>The answer is straightforward! These advanced tools help understand your audience, overall profile, and growth rate. Let’s discuss the top 6 Tik Tok money calculator tools to consider earnings on your Tik Tok account.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Top 6 Money Calculators to Help Influencers Estimate Earnings</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Tips for Earning Money on TikTok</a></li></ul><h2 id="Top-6-Money-Calculators-to-Help-Influencers-Estimate-Earnings"><a href="#Top-6-Money-Calculators-to-Help-Influencers-Estimate-Earnings" class="headerlink" title="Top 6 Money Calculators to Help Influencers Estimate Earnings"></a>Top 6 Money Calculators to Help Influencers Estimate Earnings</h2><p>Now, let’s get started by reviewing each Tik Tok money calculator in detail with the respective pros and cons. Also, remember that these tools are not in any way associated with Tik Tok officially. Instead, they act as supportive platforms for calculation.</p><h4 id="1-Tik-Tok-Influencer-Earnings-Calculator"><a href="#1-Tik-Tok-Influencer-Earnings-Calculator" class="headerlink" title="1.

However, their project of biddable ads is in progress. It will be launched soon after completion. What brands search for are different influencers either according to the niche or growth of a particular Tik Tok account. Nowadays, influencers have to contact brands for promotions or stuff like that. So, if you have more count on followers and engagement as an influencer, you would be going to get the right amount on those sponsorships.</p><p>The most important aspect is to calculate the engagement rate. It is because it’s a highly considerable factor brand may look. However, there is no official method to calculate the engagement rate. Most of the published ones are inaccurate. They won’t tell you the correct specs about the percentage of people opening the app once a day. For accuracy concerns, we’ve devised a formula to calculate individual Tik Tok account engagement. The formula states as [No. of hearts + No. of comments]&#x2F; No. of followers] × 100.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Calculates engagement rate</li><li>DIY method</li><li>Zero cost solution</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Not super effective</li></ul><h4 id="2-Igface"><a href="#2-Igface" class="headerlink" title="2.

Post a Video At Least Once Every Day"></a>1. Post a Video At Least Once Every Day</h3><p>The platform expects its successful creators to post videos often. In case you wish to go viral, you need to create enough content for people to notice you. If you would like to create a low-profile, your profile might not appear often in the user’s feed.</p><p>The top accounts release videos several times every day. However, this level of production might be difficult for one person without compromising on the video’s quality. So, upload at least one video every day.</p><h3 id="2-Make-Sure-the-Videos-are-of-High-Quality"><a href="#2-Make-Sure-the-Videos-are-of-High-Quality" class="headerlink" title="2.

Hence, you have to make sure that you are sharing footage of top-notch quality. Yes, you might have to upload videos daily, but that doesn’t mean you should sacrifice quality for quantity. For this, however, you don’t have to employ a professional camera operator. You can create videos using your smartphone and then edit them using good software. This ensures that you make videos that will go viral. You can use an external microphone if the sound is an essential component.</p><h3 id="3-Do-Not-Ignore-Sounds"><a href="#3-Do-Not-Ignore-Sounds" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Not Ignore Sounds"></a>3. Do Not Ignore Sounds</h3><p>One of the primary differences of TikTok has been the liberty that it gives you to use music in the videos that people are sharing. It is incredibly easy to add music to your 15-seconds video on this platform. TikTok has made arrangements with the top music companies to get permission to use the copyrighted music extracts.</p><p>You will be able to add music tracks to your videos without any hassle from the app itself.</p><h3 id="4-Use-Trending-Hashtags-to-Keep-Up-with-the-Trends"><a href="#4-Use-Trending-Hashtags-to-Keep-Up-with-the-Trends" class="headerlink" title="4. Use Trending Hashtags to Keep Up with the Trends"></a>4. Use Trending Hashtags to Keep Up with the Trends</h3><p>When you open the TikTok app and tap on the ‘Discover’ button present at the bottom, it is going to show the trending hashtags. It is better to emulate some posts which you see on the ‘Discover’ page if you want the videos to trend on TikTok.</p><p>The trending hashtags change on a regular basis and tend to be region-specific.</p><p>Making videos about frogs or bears might not be your thing, especially when you do not have access to either animal. So, you need to look for trending hashtags that will be more relevant to your audience.</p><h3 id="5-Showcase-Your-Skills-in-the-Video"><a href="#5-Showcase-Your-Skills-in-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="5. Showcase Your Skills in the Video"></a>5. Showcase Your Skills in the Video</h3><p>In case you are looking for content ideas for the videos, you should ask yourself the skill you have. Several Tiktokers create videos of them doing something that they are good at. This can be playing an instrument, skateboarding, or playing a sport like fire-eating or juggling. There are many dancers that showcase their skills in lip-sync videos. Hence, you need to recognize your skill and use it to make your videos.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>To make your videos stand out from the rest, you should <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >download FilmoraX on your Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and use it to edit your videos.

Throughout all of the stages of this process, there are things you can do that can help you attract a broad audience, so let’s take a look at some of the best ways to increase the reach of your videos.</p><h4 id="1-Follow-and-Unfollow-the-Most-Popular-Musers"><a href="#1-Follow-and-Unfollow-the-Most-Popular-Musers" class="headerlink" title="1. Follow and Unfollow the Most Popular Musers"></a>1. Follow and Unfollow the Most Popular Musers</h4><p>This is a simple and effective way to gain the attention of TikTok’s most influential users. Pinpoint the most successful Musers in your niche and follow and unfollow them until they follow you back. Although it may seem silly, this strategy actually works, because, after enough attempts, your favorite members of the platform will look at your profile, and follow you back if they like what they see. Try to comment on their videos, because TikTok stars share on their profiles can potentially increase the chances of being followed back, especially if your comments are always on point. Some of the people whose work you appreciate maybe even willing to share their secrets and help you get more followers.</p><h4 id="2-Make-Your-Profile-Look-Charming"><a href="#2-Make-Your-Profile-Look-Charming" class="headerlink" title="2. Make Your Profile Look Charming"></a>2. Make Your Profile Look Charming</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/charming-profile-on-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Charming Profile on TikTok"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094421/7443" target="_top" id="2094421">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094421" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094421/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Every little detail matters when it comes to optimizing your profile. The profile picture, username, or the personal information you provide can all leave a strong impression on people who visit your profile. A long username that is hard to remember isn’t going to help you gain more recognition, mostly because everyone is going to forget it soon after they hear it. Pick a short and catchy username that stands out and try avoiding using different usernames on different social media accounts. Let others know what types of videos they can expect from you by mentioning that you love making fitness videos, vlogs, or simple music videos in which you showcase your singing talents. However, it is also indispensable to be as specific as you can, so besides saying that you’re producing fitness videos, it’s also helpful if you mention that you’re making yoga or aerobics videos. Your profile is the first step to establishing communication with new followers, which is why it is important to do everything you can to encourage others to hit the follow button and start communicating with you.</p><h4 id="3-Participate-in-Viral-Challenges"><a href="#3-Participate-in-Viral-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="3. Participate in Viral Challenges"></a>3. Participate in Viral Challenges</h4><p>Following the latest social media trends is necessary because it enables you to see what other types of content are popular at the moment. Viral challenges, like the recent Kiki challenge, often involve singing and dancing to a popular song, which is why they are a great choice of content for the TikTok platform that is mostly dedicated to music videos. Using trending hashtags in the posts you share on your profile will make your viral challenge videos visible to millions of people, and it can increase your number of followers drastically in just a few days. In addition, a challenge can inspire you to explore a specific topic or a music genre further and help you build an easily recognizable style that can expand the size of your fanbase.</p><h4 id="4-Post-Your-Videos-on-Other-Social-Networks"><a href="#4-Post-Your-Videos-on-Other-Social-Networks" class="headerlink" title="4. Post Your Videos on Other Social Networks"></a>4. Post Your Videos on Other Social Networks</h4><p>Don’t limit yourself to just one social media account because if you do so, you won’t be able to reach the audiences on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. Facebook alone has 2 billion active users each month, while the size of the audience on YouTube isn’t much smaller. Managing accounts on several social networks under the same name is also an effective way to build your online reputation because people will remember the name they saw on one platform. As a result, they will start following you on the other. Posting music and all various types of videos on multiple social media accounts also means that they are going to be shared by a larger number of people.</p><h4 id="5-Don’t-Hesitate-to-Collaborate-with-Others"><a href="#5-Don’t-Hesitate-to-Collaborate-with-Others" class="headerlink" title="5. Don’t Hesitate to Collaborate with Others"></a>5. Don’t Hesitate to Collaborate with Others</h4><p>Being a one-man or a one-woman show doesn’t always pay off, especially if you’re just starting out. Recording a duo with an equally talented friend or making any other type of collab video can have a positive impact on the size of your fanbase. It is important to choose the people you work with carefully because content creators that already have a lot of followers might not be interested in collaborating with you if the number of followers you have is significantly lower than theirs. The people you choose to work with should also share your passion for the type of video you’re hoping to create since there is no point in inviting someone to make a comedy video with you if their main interest is in fashion. After selecting the person, you’re going to collaborate with. You can use the TikTok’s Duet option that offers an easy way to create a music video with someone who shares your taste in music.</p><h4 id="6-Use-Video-Editing-Apps-to-Make-Impressive-Videos"><a href="#6-Use-Video-Editing-Apps-to-Make-Impressive-Videos" class="headerlink" title="6. Use Video Editing Apps to Make Impressive Videos"></a>6. Use Video Editing Apps to Make Impressive Videos</h4><p>All videos, regardless of how short they are, benefit from the video editing process. You don’t have to use professional <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut to edit the videos you share on TikTok, because some other video editing apps offer more eye-catching filters and effects to make a captivating short music video. One of them is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The TikTok app enables you to remove all unwanted parts of the video clips you recorded, and it also features a rich library of visual effects, but it lacks some more advanced video editing options. If you’d like to create the ghost effect or to clone yourself using apps such as Video Star, Triller or MuStar is a much better option, because they offer a wider range of video editing tools than TikTok. You can also learn more user-created content from <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >User Gallery <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to empower video creation.</p><p>Free download Filmora now and make yourself a superstar on TikTok.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-apple.svg"                      alt="iOS"                ></a> <a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-google.svg"                      alt="Android"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105866/7443" target="_top" id="2105866">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105866" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105866/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="7-Be-Unique-and-Innovative"><a href="#7-Be-Unique-and-Innovative" class="headerlink" title="7. Be Unique and Innovative"></a>7. Be Unique and Innovative</h4><p>Find your own voice, because everyone else’s voice is already taken. If you try to imitate the content other creators produce, you’ll never find your own distinctive style. What’s more, the viewers of your video can easily see if you’re really enjoying making the video or not, and in many cases, that may be the reason why they decide to skip hitting the follow button. Chose topics that you’re passionate about because if you’re just following the trends, the content you produce may seem generic. Don’t be afraid to think out of the box and do something new every once in a while. Just to see how your followers react. More often than not, you’ll discover something your fans adore, and you’ll attract new followers that liked your eagerness to try out new things.</p><h4 id="8-Keep-Things-Short-and-Concise"><a href="#8-Keep-Things-Short-and-Concise" class="headerlink" title="8. Keep Things Short and Concise"></a>8. Keep Things Short and Concise</h4><p>It is not possible to record videos with the TikTok app that last longer than sixty seconds. Therefore, sticking to the one-minute limit is probably the best way to ensure that your followers watch all videos you post on your account from the beginning until the end. There is no time limit for videos you upload to your account, so you can use your phone’s camera app to make videos that are longer than one minute. However, you should tread carefully since the longer duration of a video can discourage viewers from watching the entire video. Producing short music videos can be a challenging task, but it is also a great way to showcase your creativity and inspire others to follow your work.</p><h4 id="9-You’re-Entertainer-Act-Like-One"><a href="#9-You’re-Entertainer-Act-Like-One" class="headerlink" title="9. You’re Entertainer, Act Like One"></a>9. You’re Entertainer, Act Like One</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/entertainer-on-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Entertainer on TikTok"                ></p><p>How can you expect others to have fun while watching your videos, if you don’t have fun making them? Be spontaneous, and enjoy your time in front of the camera. That way you can always keep the spectator guessing what you’re going to do next. Put on a good show, that will leave the viewers of your videos wanting to see more. You can accomplish this by adding a lot of humor to the video or by simply enjoying the moment and going with the flow. Even though there are no recipes to the success of the content you post on the TikTok platform, focusing on your performance while remembering to be funny at times is going to help you increase the number of followers.</p><h4 id="10-Post-New-Content-At-Magic-Hours"><a href="#10-Post-New-Content-At-Magic-Hours" class="headerlink" title="10. Post New Content At Magic Hours"></a>10. Post New Content At Magic Hours</h4><p>Sharing new content at least twice a day will eventually get you a massive following, because it will improve the exposure your videos are getting, but you also have to post videos at the right time. The magic posting hours on TikTok are between 11 am and 5 pm as your followers and their friends are most likely to use the app in that time frame. Get to know your audience and try to understand how frequently and at which hours they’re using the TikTok app. This will help you create a posting schedule that minimizes the chances of posting videos during parts of the day when they get the least amount of exposure.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Be different, be unique, and provide high-quality entertainment to your followers. Try to offer something fresh that will sweep your audience off their feet. The TikTok app features a nearly endless supply of music and video editing options that enable you to express your creativity freely. However, just producing great videos is not enough to attract large audiences since you also have to employ your marketing skills if you want to grow your fanbase.

And the first place to begin with that aim is in your TikTok bio.</p><p>Your bio for TikTok is your best chance to introduce yourself and your brand to each of your potential followers.</p><p>It’s because you don’t want to consume time to introduce yourself in every video, again and again, so your <strong>TikTok bios</strong> provide you with the opportunity to do just that. This is your chance to describe to your followers who you are and why they should be your followers.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p>Here, we’ll cover how to add a link to TikTok bio, 30+ TikTok bio ideas, and other fantastic tools to upgrade your TikTok profile.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Optimize Your TikTok Bio in 5 Easy Steps [updated 2024]</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: 30+ TikTok Bio Ideas in 2024</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Top 5 TikTok Bio Fonts Generators of 2024</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Best TikTok Tools for Video Editing</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Optimize-Your-TikTok-Bio-in-5-Easy-Steps-updated-2024"><a href="#Part-1-Optimize-Your-TikTok-Bio-in-5-Easy-Steps-updated-2024" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Optimize Your TikTok Bio in 5 Easy Steps [updated 2024]"></a>Part 1: Optimize Your TikTok Bio in 5 Easy Steps [updated 2024]</h2><p>Writing a TikTok bio doesn’t have to be that hard. You have to go through the five easy steps to create a bio for TikTok that will help you be successful. So, let’s dig deeper into those ultimate steps!</p><p><strong>Step 1: Describe your brand.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/describe-account-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="describe account tiktok"                ></p><p>Source: blog.hubspot.com</p><p>Describe your followers who you are and what you do. They may gather some idea of what your profile is about, based on your content. Still, it would help if you didn’t rely on that.</p><p>What if you create a video relevant to you but has nothing to do with your account? Your visitors need to learn another way to know what your business is all about.</p><p>It can be only a few words, so make sure you boil down what people want to know. And ensure your language is compelling, engaging, and gets across your account’s purpose efficiently.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Add emojis.</strong></p><p>Almost every TikTok bio contains an emoji that help you emphasize your brand’s personality and showcase your brand’s services and products without consuming much space in your TikTok bio.</p><p>For example, if you work for an eCommerce brand, particularly in clothing, you might enter a t-shirt emoji (???). Or, if your company sells video tools, you may enter a video camera emoji (???).</p><p>So, these emojis tell people what to do. And, if you want them to hit the follow button or click the link below, you could add arrows to express that without entering extra characters to influence visitors’ action.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Add a CTA.</strong></p><p>Like any attractive social media bio, you should have a CTA in your TikTok bio as well. It exactly tells your visitors what to do next. For example, you might add a CTA to direct followers to an eCommerce website, a blog post link, or another social channel like YouTube or Instagram.</p><p>Always think of including a CTA in almost every video or communication you share with your potential followers.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Don’t exceed the character limit</strong>.</p><p>TikTok has a bio character limit which is further not very big. So you only have 80 characters to summarize your TikTok bio. That’s just over half of the limit present on Instagram handles, which can be pretty tight, one of the factors emojis are super helpful. You can easily save your characters and use them wisely to communicate your brand among the followers fully. Then, pick out the most crucial angles of your brand and showcase those in your TikTok bio.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Add a link in your TikTok bio.</strong></p><p>TikTok gives you a link adding space as well, so if it’s currently accessible in your account, you should use it. And, we’ll also discuss how to add a link to TikTok’s bio, an excellent method to direct traffic off the platform to other promotion pages.</p><p>So, you can direct them to a relevant landing page or e-book and capture their contact info or an email address, or you can share the sales page for the most current product you touted in your video.</p><p>Thus, there are numerous ways you can optimize your TikTok bio ideas.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Link-to-TikTok-Bio"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Link-to-TikTok-Bio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?"></a>Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?</h2><p>First, to know how to add a link to TikTok bio, you can send traffic to only a single URL. You can select your most recent blog post, a dedicated landing page, your homepage, social media profile, or any other page you’d like.</p><p>The other way is to promote multiple links through a bio service. With this type of service, people can get directed to a web page with a collection of page links to visit.</p><p>You could include affiliate links, blog links, products, or even your other social media handles. Using a TikTok bio link service helps you to give your visitors more ways of connecting with people outside of TikTok.</p><p><strong>Accessing the Link in Bio on TikTok</strong></p><p>Yet, there is a caveat to the <strong>TikTok bio</strong> link option: not everyone can add a link to their <strong>TikTok bio</strong>. Most Android users have this option, while some iOS users are still waiting. Follow the steps below to check:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Hit the <strong>“Edit your profile”</strong> tab</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Check for the option “<strong>Website</strong>“ underneath the section to edit TikTok bio.</p><p>There’s no issue if you don’t have that option. You can join the TikTok Testers program by easily downloading a separate app called <strong>Testflight</strong> through the app store.</p><p>Next, open your current TikTok app and tap the three dots in your profile page’s upper right-hand corner to enter the “<strong>Settings</strong>“ window. Then, scroll down and click <strong>“Join TikTok Testers.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-beta.jpg"                      alt="tiktok beta"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012434/19272" target="_top" id="2012434">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012434" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012434/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Follow those instructions, and you’ll be able to access the different Beta versions of TikTok after they get released.

Download Video Star App"></a>1. Download Video Star App</h4><p>Choosing a location, mounting your iPhone on a tripod, or picking the positions for each of your clones are all important steps you’ll need to take before you actually start recording. There are several apps that enable you to create clone videos easily, but in this article, we are going to show you how you can clone yourself with Video Star. The app can be downloaded from the App Store for free, but additional in-app purchases are necessary if you want to have access to all the power packs Video Star offers. You don’t have to record the video clips with this app since the iPhone’s native camera app is powerful enough to enable you to record high-quality footage.</p><h4 id="2-Edit-Multiple-Video-Clips"><a href="#2-Edit-Multiple-Video-Clips" class="headerlink" title="2. Edit Multiple Video Clips"></a>2. Edit Multiple Video Clips</h4><p>After you record all the positions for your next clone video with the iPhone’s native camera app, you should cut the video clips and keep only the parts where you are perfectly positioned, so your position in one clip doesn’t overlap with other positions. During the video recording process try to create as much separation between two positions in order to avoid any chance of overlapping. One of the best ways to achieve this is to shoot at a location that is spacious enough so you can make enough separation between two positions. Keep in mind that the maximum number of clips you can combine in the Video Star app is limited to just three, so if you want to have more than three clones in the shot you first have to piece together three clips, save them as a single file and then add more clips to the cloned video you created.</p><h4 id="3-Level-up-Your-Videos-with-Video-Star"><a href="#3-Level-up-Your-Videos-with-Video-Star" class="headerlink" title="3. Level up Your Videos with Video Star"></a>3. Level up Your Videos with Video Star</h4><p>Video Star also enables you to shoot your videos from the app, and you can adjust the Countdown before the app starts recording or the Recording Speed. Make sure to enter the lowest Recording Speed value possible, because that way you’ll be recording like TikTok does on fast.</p><p>Tap the Record button, then select the Multiple options, and play the video that contains the song you previously selected. Once you reach the spot in the song where you want to introduce the clone simply tap Set, so the recording will stop at the designated point and you can move to another position. If at any point during recording you realize that your movements extend to your clone’s location, you can simply tap on the hamburger icon and select the Delete Last option.</p><p>To preview the video, you just have to tap on the Scissors icon, and the recorded video will automatically start playing. The Record New Clip in the Scissors menu lets you start from the beginning in case you’re not happy with the results or you can use this option to start recording the video with the second position of your clone.</p><p>When done, head back to the Scissors menu, and tap on the Multi-Layer Clip. This feature doesn’t come with the free version of the app, and you must purchase it in order to create a clone video. This action will enable you to select the back and front clips. After selecting the clips, the Mask Front menu will appear on the screen, choose the Shape option and use the hamburger icon on the right side of the screen to change the video’s shape to Rectangle. Drag the rectangle in the preview window so you can crop the first clip to match the demands of your video and press the Next icon to continue the video editing process.</p><p>Alternatively, you can use the Erase option to remove the unwanted parts of each video. You can find this option in the Mask Front or Mask Back menu, so just select it and use your finger to remove sections of the shot you don’t want to use.</p><p>The Add Effect menu will pop up on the screen so you can add different effects to your first video clip, and then repeat the entire process for the back clip. Once you’ve edited the second clip tap on the Create button to complete the process of making a multilayer clip. Tap Done to save the clip to your camera roll, and upload it to TikTok.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075472/7443" target="_top" id="2075472">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075472" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075472/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Cloning yourself in a video using the Video Star app is a simple process that can be mastered in a short period of time.

It does not just let you share your talent and creativity; you can also create a big fandom by having millions of followers. While the app has built-in presets and effects, the good news is that you can edit the videos using great computer software. And directly upload it to your TikTok account from your system.</p><p>Yes, you heard that right! You can download TikTok or any other Android application using the emulator BlueStacks. However, at the moment, the TikTok app is only available for smartphones, which means that you can’t use it from a computer. However, you can install the BlueStacks emulator that lets you use apps from the Google Play Store on Windows and Mac operating systems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-tiktok-on-computer.jpg"                      alt="Download TikTok on Computer"                ></p><p>Installing BlueStacks might be slightly complicated, so in this article, we are going to take you through the installation process of this emulator, and we’ll show you how to install <strong>TikTok on PC and Mac</strong>.

You can do it by visiting the website and downloading the software to your computer. Then locate the <strong>exe. file</strong> you downloaded and double-click on it. Once the installer launches, click on the <strong>Install Now</strong> button. After the installation is completed, click on the <strong>Complete</strong> button.</p><p>Now the BlueStacks emulator is installed on your PC. Launch it and head over to the <strong>App Center</strong> tab. You will be asked to sign in to your Google account. And if you don’t have one, you need to create a Google account for using TikTok or any other Android app from your computer.</p><p>You can type TikTok into the <strong>Search Bar</strong> that is located in the upper right corner of the emulator’s window in order to find the TikTok app on Google Play. Once the app appears in the search results, click on it and proceed to click on the <strong>Install</strong> button. Click <strong>Accept</strong> in the pop-up window to give the app access to the computer’s camera. And then after the TikTok app is installed, click on the <strong>Open</strong> button.</p><p>You can use the app to record new videos, add sounds, apply filters and effects or trim each video you recorded with TikTok.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-tiktok-on-pc.png"                      alt="Download TikTok on PC"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Install-TikTok-on-a-Mac-Computer"><a href="#How-to-Install-TikTok-on-a-Mac-Computer" class="headerlink" title="How to Install TikTok on a Mac Computer?"></a>How to Install TikTok on a Mac Computer?</h2><p>The process of installing the TikTok app on a Mac computer might be a bit more complicated, because the BlueStacks emulator may cause your computer to crash. In order to avoid this, you’d better shut down all other apps and permit the software to be installed on your device. Here’s how you can install TikTok on your Mac devices.</p><p>Step 1. Go to the BlueStacks website and click on the <strong>Download</strong> button to initiate the download process.</p><p>Step 2. Open the folder where the BlueStacks installer is located, find the <strong>installer</strong> <strong>dmg. file</strong>, and then double-click on it.</p><p>Step 3. Once the installer window appears on the screen, double-click on the <strong>BlueStacks icon</strong> to start the installation and then click <strong>Continue</strong>.</p><p>If the <strong>System Extension</strong> blocked message from appearing on the screen, choose the <strong>Open Security Preferences</strong> and click on the <strong>Allow</strong> button. The emulator will then be installed on your computer.</p><p>In order to install the TikTok app on your Mac, you’ll have to create a Google account if you don’t have one. Once you sign in with your Google account, you can proceed to install the app on your computer. The steps for installing TikTok on PC and Mac computers are the same, so you just need to find the app in the Google Play Store and click on the <strong>Install</strong> button. You can access the TikTok app from the <strong>My Apps</strong> tab in the BlueStack emulator whenever you want to create a new video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1912746">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1912746.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1912746">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1912746.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fmindmanager.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1912746%2F20231'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1912746/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Edit-TikTok-Videos-with-Excellent-Video-Editor"><a href="#Edit-TikTok-Videos-with-Excellent-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Edit TikTok Videos with Excellent Video Editor"></a>Edit TikTok Videos with Excellent Video Editor</h2><p>After installing the TikTok app on your personal computer, why not start using it right after you finish <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >editing your videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?

Anyone can go viral and become TikTok famous by gaining more likes, lots of views, and video shares. TikTok’s algorithm can put your videos at the top of the “For You” scroll and turn you into a sensation overnight, thus skyrocketing your followers count in a matter of few days. But, did you know that TikTok removed almost 50 million videos in just 6 months because those videos violated its rules?</p><p>While this social media site can easily be your shot to fame, it can even take away your audience. Or worse, it can ban you from using the app if you do not follow its community guidelines and rules. And, if you’ve been on TikTok for a while now, chances are you’ve heard about users getting ‘shadowbanned’. It’s not unusual for users to unknowingly stop receiving likes, views, and traffic on their accounts due to <strong>TikTok shadowban</strong>.</p><p>Ever since the influx of social media, shadow banning, also known as ghost banning or stealth banning, has been around. It comes up when content has been blocked or partially blocked. Sadly, when your TikTok account is shadowbanned, it will negatively affect your reach and halt your growth. Influencers and businesses rely on social media to create a community. And when they lose a part of that community, they feel a loss of support.</p><p>Wondering what shadowbanning entails, how to determine if you’ve been shadowbanned, and <strong>how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok</strong>? Check out below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

Basically, it means your account has been banned. But, the shadow part of the term means that you won’t know about the ban.</p><p>Shadowban on TikTok is a restriction that prevents your videos from appearing on the <strong>For You</strong> page or on hashtag results. It is a situation where your visibility has been reduced or where you have been banned from the platform, without your knowledge.</p><p>The act of shadowbanning a TikTok account is an automatic process done by TikTok’s algorithm to protect other users against spam content, copyright issues, and adult content. When you get shadowbanned, you stop receiving likes, views, and traffic from the For You page. Often, shadowbans go unnoticed until another user who stumbled upon your video points it out.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban"><a href="#Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?"></a>Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?</h2><p>At the early stages of TikTok, shadowbans lasted for 24 hours. But, with the latest update in the TikTok algorithm, the length of TikTok shadowban is growing. Nowadays, a TikTok account is shadowbanned for approximately up to 2 weeks.</p><p>Within the first week, there will be a drop in your followers and so will the views. After a few days of the account shadowban being in place, you won’t be able to enter any tags or make new videos on TikTok unless they are public.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-shadowban.png"                      alt="tiktok shadowban"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135362/19272" target="_top" id="2135362">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135362" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135362/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?"></a>Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?</h2><p>The TikTok app doesn’t ever actually tell if you are shadowbanned. But, if you are then you can probably notice it. If you are shadowbanned, your videos will neither show up on the TikTok “For You” page nor will they appear when you search them via hashtag.</p><p>During a TikTok shadowban, your videos and content will not:</p><ul><li>be visible in the search results</li><li>be visible on the feed</li><li>receive new followers</li><li>receive likes from others</li><li>receive comments from others</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148650/16836" target="_top" id="2148650">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148650" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148650/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?"></a>Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok has not issued any explanation on its shadowbanning techniques. However, what makes complete sense is that TikTok shadowbans its users for creating videos that violate its community guidelines.</p><p>Any video with offensive content that can harm the sentiments of people or anything that can trigger other users can attract TikTok shadowban. The app might limit the visibility of your content for reasons such as your account acting as spam or you are posting inappropriate content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shadowbanned-on-tiktok.png"                      alt="shadowbanned on tiktok"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129043/19576" target="_top" id="2129043">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129043" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129043/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Spam Behavior</strong></p><p>The primary reason why a user’s TikTok account can get shadowbanned is that they behave like a spammer. Usually, new people go on a spree of liking and following people in the hope that they will like and follow back. However, TikTok might recognize this behavior as spam and consider you as a robot.</p><p>If you like more than 100 posts daily, you might want to slow down. If you follow more than 50 TikTok accounts in a day, it is best to re-evaluate that strategy.</p><p><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong></p><p>Posting videos that go against the TikTok rules and community guidelines can get you shadowbanned or permanently banned.</p><p>The following content is considered inappropriate by TikTok:</p><ul><li>hate speech</li><li>fake news</li><li>violence</li><li>nudity</li><li>drugs</li><li>copyrighted music</li></ul><p>TikTok is committed to make its platform an inclusive and safe space. So, if you have experienced a drop in views or engagement, consider reassessing your recent content.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?"></a>Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?</h2><p>Wondering about how do you get unshadowbanned on TikTok? Here’s what you can do to remove your shadowban:</p><h4 id="Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok"><a href="#Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok"></a>Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok</h4><p>Firstly, delete your recent video. If it doesn’t work, uninstall and then reinstall the TikTok app. Sometimes, your app might just need an update to become functional once again.</p><h4 id="Switch-to-A-Pro-Account"><a href="#Switch-to-A-Pro-Account" class="headerlink" title="Switch to A Pro Account"></a>Switch to A Pro Account</h4><p>When doing a Google search on how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok, the most common tip you’ll find is to go into the Settings of your TikTok account and tap “Switch to a Pro Account”. The reason is that making the switch will allow you to see analytics for your posts and find out how people access your videos. By doing this, you can easily monitor how far your engagement has increased or dropped.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-pro-account.jpg"                      alt="tiktok pro account"                ></p><h4 id="Delete-Offensive-Content"><a href="#Delete-Offensive-Content" class="headerlink" title="Delete Offensive Content"></a>Delete Offensive Content</h4><p>You should delete content that goes against the rules and community guidelines laid down by TikTok. After deleting inappropriate content, you have to wait for at least two weeks to get the shadowban lifted. You can refresh your device once in a while to check if you have finally managed to lift the ban.</p><h4 id="Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime"><a href="#Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime" class="headerlink" title="Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime"></a>Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime</h4><p>Once you have deleted offensive content, clear the cache, close your app, ensure it is updated and then take a break from TikTok for a few days. Coming back after you have cleaned up your account and taken the needed break might get you unshadowbanned on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Post-Original-Innovative-Content"><a href="#Post-Original-Innovative-Content" class="headerlink" title="Post Original, Innovative Content"></a>Post Original, Innovative Content</h4><p>When you return to posting content, you need to make sure your TikTok account doesn’t get shadowbanned again. Your account has already been flagged for something and so you need to try even harder to behave. If you go back to posting the same kind of content that got you banned in the first place, you will be booted off the stage again.</p><p>Ensure you always post original content with innovative ideas. Brainstorm new ideas with your team and come up with something new and unique. This way, you can avoid copyright infringement laws on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Know-Your-Audience-More"><a href="#Know-Your-Audience-More" class="headerlink" title="Know Your Audience More"></a>Know Your Audience More</h4><p>These days, there are many kids and minor accounts on TikTok, and maintaining a healthy environment is a part of your responsibility. Keep your videos free from sexualized themes, nudity, pornographic material, and suggestive themes. Remember; posting such content can land you in serious trouble with TikTok shadowban.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Use-Excellent-Video-Editors-to-Make-Amazing-TikTok-Videos"><a href="#Part-6-Use-Excellent-Video-Editors-to-Make-Amazing-TikTok-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Use Excellent Video Editors to Make Amazing TikTok Videos"></a>Part 6: Use Excellent Video Editors to Make Amazing TikTok Videos</h2><p>With increasing competition among TikTok users, it is important to use a powerful video editing tool to make your TikTok videos stand out.

Throughout all of the stages of this process, there are things you can do that can help you attract a broad audience, so let’s take a look at some of the best ways to increase the reach of your videos.</p><h4 id="1-Follow-and-Unfollow-the-Most-Popular-Musers"><a href="#1-Follow-and-Unfollow-the-Most-Popular-Musers" class="headerlink" title="1. Follow and Unfollow the Most Popular Musers"></a>1. Follow and Unfollow the Most Popular Musers</h4><p>This is a simple and effective way to gain the attention of TikTok’s most influential users. Pinpoint the most successful Musers in your niche and follow and unfollow them until they follow you back. Although it may seem silly, this strategy actually works, because, after enough attempts, your favorite members of the platform will look at your profile, and follow you back if they like what they see. Try to comment on their videos, because TikTok stars share on their profiles can potentially increase the chances of being followed back, especially if your comments are always on point. Some of the people whose work you appreciate maybe even willing to share their secrets and help you get more followers.</p><h4 id="2-Make-Your-Profile-Look-Charming"><a href="#2-Make-Your-Profile-Look-Charming" class="headerlink" title="2. Make Your Profile Look Charming"></a>2.

The profile picture, username, or the personal information you provide can all leave a strong impression on people who visit your profile. A long username that is hard to remember isn’t going to help you gain more recognition, mostly because everyone is going to forget it soon after they hear it. Pick a short and catchy username that stands out and try avoiding using different usernames on different social media accounts. Let others know what types of videos they can expect from you by mentioning that you love making fitness videos, vlogs, or simple music videos in which you showcase your singing talents. However, it is also indispensable to be as specific as you can, so besides saying that you’re producing fitness videos, it’s also helpful if you mention that you’re making yoga or aerobics videos. Your profile is the first step to establishing communication with new followers, which is why it is important to do everything you can to encourage others to hit the follow button and start communicating with you.</p><h4 id="3-Participate-in-Viral-Challenges"><a href="#3-Participate-in-Viral-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="3. Participate in Viral Challenges"></a>3. Participate in Viral Challenges</h4><p>Following the latest social media trends is necessary because it enables you to see what other types of content are popular at the moment. Viral challenges, like the recent Kiki challenge, often involve singing and dancing to a popular song, which is why they are a great choice of content for the TikTok platform that is mostly dedicated to music videos. Using trending hashtags in the posts you share on your profile will make your viral challenge videos visible to millions of people, and it can increase your number of followers drastically in just a few days. In addition, a challenge can inspire you to explore a specific topic or a music genre further and help you build an easily recognizable style that can expand the size of your fanbase.</p><h4 id="4-Post-Your-Videos-on-Other-Social-Networks"><a href="#4-Post-Your-Videos-on-Other-Social-Networks" class="headerlink" title="4. Post Your Videos on Other Social Networks"></a>4. Post Your Videos on Other Social Networks</h4><p>Don’t limit yourself to just one social media account because if you do so, you won’t be able to reach the audiences on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. Facebook alone has 2 billion active users each month, while the size of the audience on YouTube isn’t much smaller. Managing accounts on several social networks under the same name is also an effective way to build your online reputation because people will remember the name they saw on one platform. As a result, they will start following you on the other. Posting music and all various types of videos on multiple social media accounts also means that they are going to be shared by a larger number of people.</p><h4 id="5-Don’t-Hesitate-to-Collaborate-with-Others"><a href="#5-Don’t-Hesitate-to-Collaborate-with-Others" class="headerlink" title="5. Don’t Hesitate to Collaborate with Others"></a>5. Don’t Hesitate to Collaborate with Others</h4><p>Being a one-man or a one-woman show doesn’t always pay off, especially if you’re just starting out. Recording a duo with an equally talented friend or making any other type of collab video can have a positive impact on the size of your fanbase. It is important to choose the people you work with carefully because content creators that already have a lot of followers might not be interested in collaborating with you if the number of followers you have is significantly lower than theirs. The people you choose to work with should also share your passion for the type of video you’re hoping to create since there is no point in inviting someone to make a comedy video with you if their main interest is in fashion. After selecting the person, you’re going to collaborate with. You can use the TikTok’s Duet option that offers an easy way to create a music video with someone who shares your taste in music.</p><h4 id="6-Use-Video-Editing-Apps-to-Make-Impressive-Videos"><a href="#6-Use-Video-Editing-Apps-to-Make-Impressive-Videos" class="headerlink" title="6. Use Video Editing Apps to Make Impressive Videos"></a>6. Use Video Editing Apps to Make Impressive Videos</h4><p>All videos, regardless of how short they are, benefit from the video editing process. You don’t have to use professional <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut to edit the videos you share on TikTok, because some other video editing apps offer more eye-catching filters and effects to make a captivating short music video. One of them is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The TikTok app enables you to remove all unwanted parts of the video clips you recorded, and it also features a rich library of visual effects, but it lacks some more advanced video editing options. If you’d like to create the ghost effect or to clone yourself using apps such as Video Star, Triller or MuStar is a much better option, because they offer a wider range of video editing tools than TikTok. You can also learn more user-created content from <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >User Gallery <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to empower video creation.</p><p>Free download Filmora now and make yourself a superstar on TikTok.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1770776">                    <video width="240" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770776.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1770776">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770776.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftokenmetrics.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1770776%2F20702'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1770776/20702"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-apple.svg"                      alt="iOS"                ></a> <a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-google.svg"                      alt="Android"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012406/19272" target="_top" id="2012406">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012406" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012406/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="7-Be-Unique-and-Innovative"><a href="#7-Be-Unique-and-Innovative" class="headerlink" title="7. Be Unique and Innovative"></a>7. Be Unique and Innovative</h4><p>Find your own voice, because everyone else’s voice is already taken. If you try to imitate the content other creators produce, you’ll never find your own distinctive style. What’s more, the viewers of your video can easily see if you’re really enjoying making the video or not, and in many cases, that may be the reason why they decide to skip hitting the follow button. Chose topics that you’re passionate about because if you’re just following the trends, the content you produce may seem generic. Don’t be afraid to think out of the box and do something new every once in a while. Just to see how your followers react. More often than not, you’ll discover something your fans adore, and you’ll attract new followers that liked your eagerness to try out new things.</p><h4 id="8-Keep-Things-Short-and-Concise"><a href="#8-Keep-Things-Short-and-Concise" class="headerlink" title="8. Keep Things Short and Concise"></a>8. Keep Things Short and Concise</h4><p>It is not possible to record videos with the TikTok app that last longer than sixty seconds. Therefore, sticking to the one-minute limit is probably the best way to ensure that your followers watch all videos you post on your account from the beginning until the end. There is no time limit for videos you upload to your account, so you can use your phone’s camera app to make videos that are longer than one minute. However, you should tread carefully since the longer duration of a video can discourage viewers from watching the entire video. Producing short music videos can be a challenging task, but it is also a great way to showcase your creativity and inspire others to follow your work.</p><h4 id="9-You’re-Entertainer-Act-Like-One"><a href="#9-You’re-Entertainer-Act-Like-One" class="headerlink" title="9. You’re Entertainer, Act Like One"></a>9. You’re Entertainer, Act Like One</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/entertainer-on-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Entertainer on TikTok"                ></p><p>How can you expect others to have fun while watching your videos, if you don’t have fun making them? Be spontaneous, and enjoy your time in front of the camera. That way you can always keep the spectator guessing what you’re going to do next. Put on a good show, that will leave the viewers of your videos wanting to see more. You can accomplish this by adding a lot of humor to the video or by simply enjoying the moment and going with the flow. Even though there are no recipes to the success of the content you post on the TikTok platform, focusing on your performance while remembering to be funny at times is going to help you increase the number of followers.</p><h4 id="10-Post-New-Content-At-Magic-Hours"><a href="#10-Post-New-Content-At-Magic-Hours" class="headerlink" title="10. Post New Content At Magic Hours"></a>10. Post New Content At Magic Hours</h4><p>Sharing new content at least twice a day will eventually get you a massive following, because it will improve the exposure your videos are getting, but you also have to post videos at the right time. The magic posting hours on TikTok are between 11 am and 5 pm as your followers and their friends are most likely to use the app in that time frame. Get to know your audience and try to understand how frequently and at which hours they’re using the TikTok app. This will help you create a posting schedule that minimizes the chances of posting videos during parts of the day when they get the least amount of exposure.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Be different, be unique, and provide high-quality entertainment to your followers. Try to offer something fresh that will sweep your audience off their feet. The TikTok app features a nearly endless supply of music and video editing options that enable you to express your creativity freely. However, just producing great videos is not enough to attract large audiences since you also have to employ your marketing skills if you want to grow your fanbase.

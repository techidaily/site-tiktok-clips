There is no two way about the fact that this app is the new kid in town. It is highly popular among the younger generation.</p><p>If you are a new TikToker, you need an introduction video. This has to be engaging enough to attract more and more followers. The primary aim of an introduction video is to say high to your followers and tell them about yourself. With this video, they will get to know you better.</p><p>You May Also Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Upload a Video to TikTok from Mac or PC&gt;&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Section-1-Make-an-Intro-Video-on-TikTok-iPhone"><a href="#Section-1-Make-an-Intro-Video-on-TikTok-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Section 1. Make an Intro Video on TikTok (iPhone)"></a>Section 1. Make an Intro Video on TikTok (iPhone)</h2><p>In case you are all set to create a Tiktok intro video, here are a few tips you need to follow.</p><p>• Including Audio</p><p>At the top of the screen, you will find the option ‘Sound’. This is where you can look through the music. When you are done choosing the song, decide where you would like it to start and play it when you record to sync the shots better. You can also add sound effects and voice-over.</p><p>At present, you can add one song per video inside the app. However, you always have the option to edit the videos using other apps to upload on TikTok.</p><p>In TikTok, you can work with multiple audio layers. For example, you have recorded the clip with in-camera audio, sound effect, music, and anything else you have added. The app will let you lower the camera’s audio volume while raising the music volume.</p><p>• Working with the Text</p><p>For adding title or text to the video, you have to use the Text button. This lets you choose the color, font, and size of the words. If you have used Instagram fonts, this will appear similar. Once you enter the words, choose where you would like to apply them on the screen. You can also set the time and length of the text appearing on the screen.</p><p>• Adding Effects</p><p>Effects are one of the special aspects of TikTok. There are two ways to use them, before or after recording. When you’re done recording the video, you can reverse it, speed it up, or add filters. The app also lets you apply an effect when you are recording.</p><p>Since TikTok videos are mostly viewed on smartphones, vertical orientation is the best option. However, horizontal orientation is also allowed on TikTok. <strong>The best aspect ratio will be 9:16 for TikTok videos</strong> so that they can be viewed properly on any smartphone. Last, but not least, <strong>the dimension has to be 1080 x 1920.</strong></p><h2 id="Section-2-Make-a-TikTok-Intro-Video-on-Mac"><a href="#Section-2-Make-a-TikTok-Intro-Video-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Section 2.

While they perform similar tasks, the distinction between their language models creates varying results. You’ll trigger new responses even if you repeat your prompts.</p><p> Regardless of which tool you use more often, you’d do well to know its unique features. Here are nine notable differences between ChatGPT and Bing’s version of the bot.</p><h2 id="1-Purpose"><a href="#1-Purpose" class="headerlink" title="1. Purpose"></a>1. Purpose</h2><p> Although both ChatGPT and Bing AI use generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) language models, they’re different platforms. ChatGPT is a multipurpose chatbot. It scans the vast yet limited resources from which it was trained. This includes academic journals, business websites, publications, and Wikipedia.</p><p> Meanwhile, Bing’s version of the chatbot is essentially an AI-powered search engine. The platform has more sophisticated indexing and scanning, plus the integrated AI chat feature. It acts as both a search engine and a chatbot.</p><p> Despite these nuances, ChatGPT and Bing execute similar functions. With the correct prompts, they could write essays, answer general knowledge queries, recap books, and scrutinize arguments, among other tasks. Just expect varied responses based on their trained datasets.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123729/7443" target="_top" id="2123729">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123729" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123729/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Conversational-Language"><a href="#2-Conversational-Language" class="headerlink" title="2. Conversational Language"></a>2. Conversational Language</h2><p> ChatGPT and Bing both use the GPT model. This advanced natural language processing (NLP) system responds to prompts with human-like text. It answers follow-up questions, analyzes problems, and challenges non-factual statements.</p><p> Both ChatGPT and Bing’s AI can carry out conversations. But as you explore these tools, you’ll notice that the latter has a slightly more sophisticated model–its responses sound natural.</p><p> Take the below conversation from ChatGPT as an example.

Data Accuracy"></a>3. Data Accuracy</h2><p> ChatGPT has explicit disclaimers about data inaccuracy. The platform occasionally produces incorrect information since it carries limited knowledge of events after 2021. It doesn’t even know its own release date.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chatgpt-making-precise-answers.jpg"                      alt="Asking ChatGPT About Its Launch Date"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/798161/11305" target="_top" id="798161">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-798161" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i110150.net/i/5597632/798161/11305"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Whereas Bing AI’s advanced language model and integrated search engine produce more reliable, precise data. Unlike ChatGPT, Microsoft didn’t train Bing on limited datasets. Instead, it uses its search engine to pull timely, relevant information about world events and general knowledge questions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bing-ai-giving-precise-dates.jpg"                      alt="Asking Bing AI About ChatGPT Launch"                ></p><p> It’s also worth noting that Bing’s AI cites sources. Neither platform guarantees 100% accuracy, but knowing which resources to double-check streamlines fact-checking.</p><h2 id="4-Mathematical-Precision"><a href="#4-Mathematical-Precision" class="headerlink" title="4. Mathematical Precision"></a>4. Mathematical Precision</h2><p> ChatGPT and Bing AI understand math. The bots can analyze equations, perform computations based on their datasets, and generate output through their language models.</p><p> You can’t expect 100% accurate results, but both Bing and<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-solve-math-problems/" >ChatGPT demonstrate strong mathematical precision and numeracy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It’s worth noting that ChatGPT drastically improved since its launch—it often got word problems wrong during its first few months.</p><p> Now, however, discrepancies only arise when you explore the more intricate branches of math, such as advanced statistics, physics, and probability. For example, ChatGPT can already intermediate-level physics questions like this correctly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chatgpt-solving-physics-questions.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Solving Physics Question About Deadlifts of Lamar Grant"                ></p><p>Bing AI answers the same physics question correctly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bing-ai-solving-physics-question.jpg"                      alt="Bing AI Solving Physics Question About Deadlifts of Lamar Grant"                ></p><h2 id="5-Security-Measures"><a href="#5-Security-Measures" class="headerlink" title="5. Security Measures"></a>5. Security Measures</h2><p> Cybercriminals started misusing ChatGPT almost immediately. Consequently, some saw<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-cybersecurity-threat/" >ChatGPT as a cybersecurity threat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that lets crooks write spam emails, develop malware, and build phishing links.</p><p> OpenAI acknowledges these issues. The company discloses that ChatGPT might produce biased or harmful content, although developers continuously work on security.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chatgpt-tomie-portrayal.jpg"                      alt="Overriding ChatGPT Limits Through Character Portrayal"                ></p><p> Bing’s AI bot faces similar cybersecurity risks. It combats them by enforcing stricter limitations, reducing the platform’s susceptibility to jailbreaking. Conversations get terminated if you mention anything unusual.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bingai-security-feature.jpg"                      alt="Bing AI Ends Conversation for Security"                ></p><h2 id="6-Accessibility"><a href="#6-Accessibility" class="headerlink" title="6. Accessibility"></a>6. Accessibility</h2><p> One of the first complaints about ChatGPT was its lack of accessibility—it initially only had a web app. OpenAI only released the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-on-android-and-ios/" >official iOS and mobile versions of ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in mid-2023.</p><p> Alternatively, Bing AI offered cross-platform accessibility right from the get-go. Its chat feature is available on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.bing.com/" >Bing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website, a Microsoft Edge browser extension, and Bing’s mobile app. You could even<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/use-bing-chat-on-skype/" >use Bing Chat on Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by adding it to your contacts.</p><p> Perhaps the only limitation of Bing AI is that it doesn’t run on third-party browsers, like Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome. You’ll have to download Microsoft Edge. Although seemingly trivial, you might find it inconvenient if Edge isn’t your default browser.</p><h2 id="7-Sign-Up-Process"><a href="#7-Sign-Up-Process" class="headerlink" title="7.

It even uses its search engine before responding. You can expect to get more accurate, reliable responses and up-to-date information.</p><p> Unfortunately, Bing’s tight security measures impede versatility. The conversations automatically end once you violate the guidelines, plus you have to start a new topic every 15 messages.</p><p> If you want more control, try ChatGPT. It has limited datasets and only runs on GPT-3.5, but you’ll<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-get-best-results-from-chatgpt/" >get better results on ChatGPT by crafting creative prompts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . You could even set custom instructions beforehand.</p><p> ChatGPT will automatically apply these to every conversation moving forward, unless you instruct otherwise. It’s a helpful feature if you need specific, personalized output.</p><p> Instead of feeding Bing’s AI and ChatGPT generic prompts, curate unique ones based on their language models. The quality of their responses depends on your prompts.

TikTok now seems to be a part of everyone’s life through the most popular lip-syncing videos, one-act dance routines, 1-min recipes, funny clips, and stuff like the bottle cap challenge.</p><p>More or less the heart and soul of today’s teenagers and young adults, and sometimes even senior citizens, TikTok now has over 1 billion users and became the World’s 7th most downloaded app, all within a span of 3years since its release in 2016.</p><p>What started with fun and games has become a serious platform to showcase one’s talent and gain followers, earn money, and even stardom. Such provisions have stirred fierce competition among influencers, for what seems like the Wars of Creativity to publish more and more viral-worthy videos.</p><p>If you are an influencer looking for new and amazing <strong>TikTok ideas</strong> to make your videos go viral, then here is a stimulus.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: TikTok vs YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers</a></li></ul><h2 id="TikTok-vs-YouTube"><a href="#TikTok-vs-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="TikTok vs YouTube"></a>TikTok vs YouTube</h2><p>TikTok may be one of a kind, but it is not the only platform where you can publish your mobile-made videos without much ado. The protagonist of that story is still, YouTube. TikTok being a game-changer in the scene, is giving maximum competition to all other social networks and digital platforms that deal with video-sharing, such as Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. But the tiff between YouTube and TikTok surpasses all other competitions because only these two are all about Videos.</p><h4 id="Nature-of-Content"><a href="#Nature-of-Content" class="headerlink" title="Nature of Content"></a>Nature of Content</h4><p>The main difference between YouTube and TikTok is the nature of the content. YouTube is a broader spectrum than TikTok, for it contains feature-length movies, episodes of off-air Television Series, music videos, podcasts, and personal videos is just a part of it. But TikTok revolves around short video clips. And just that.</p><h4 id="User-Base"><a href="#User-Base" class="headerlink" title="User Base"></a>User Base</h4><p>TikTok has a niche user base, with the majority of users between 16 and 25 yo. Meanwhile, YouTube reserves a universal user base, catering to people of all ages and from different walks of life.</p><h4 id="Outreach"><a href="#Outreach" class="headerlink" title="Outreach"></a>Outreach</h4><p>TikTok is primarily a casual, youth-centric platform. While it is useful for highlighting one’s talent and engaging a loyal fanbase, it is not ideal for business promotion, or to present a show in a traditional way, which is a substantial offering of YouTube. But on the flip side, due to the vastness of YouTube, short and casual videos like the ones typically available in TikTok, have limited scope to go viral.</p><p>Therefore, the difference between TikTok and YouTube is like Apples and Oranges. They are both fruits and are sweet. But are different species with different tastes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1630055">                    <video width="192" height="320" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1630055.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-1630055">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1630055.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:120px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fcaperobbin.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1630055%2F18460'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1630055/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers"><a href="#Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers"></a>Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers</h2><h4 id="1-Music-Videos"><a href="#1-Music-Videos" class="headerlink" title="1. Music Videos"></a>1. Music Videos</h4><p>A common theme of most viral TikTok videos is they tend to be cute and cuddly. As part of music videos, you are required to imitate certain adorable songs by performing their actions either using your hands or by putting your whole body into action. These songs can be typically found in the trending section of the app and it does not take much effort to figure out the ones that are high in popularity. The catch here is that you need to be among the frontrunners in terms of covering these songs so that you can find yourself a large captive audience to influence at the earliest.</p><p>Here is an example of <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsPbFnhZQ/" >a girl showing off her TikTok music video skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2-Dance-Videos"><a href="#2-Dance-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2. Dance Videos"></a>2. Dance Videos</h4><p>If it is short, funny, and uses the correct hashtags, your dance video can create a lot of influence among your followers. Oh, and don’t forget to pair them up with the correct background score. A song that is already trending and popular on the social platform will only boost your video’s chances of a hit. A short and easy dance always does the business, even better if it can be used for a meme.</p><p>This is a good example of what <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsN-RFmQn/" >your dance video should look like <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Now isn’t that the perfect ingredient for the next viral meme on the market!</p><h4 id="3-Calming-Videos"><a href="#3-Calming-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Calming Videos"></a>3. Calming Videos</h4><p>Just because it’s a TikTok video doesn’t mean that it has to be over-the-top and loud. Sometimes, keeping things simple is the secret to success. Calming videos are those where something that most would otherwise consider weird or mundane exerts a feeling of calm on the viewer. Most social media platforms have helped such videos gain immense popularity but finding the right explanation of what these pertain to is a pretty difficult task.</p><p>Look at this video of <a class="link"   href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/705446729114378862/" >color droplets being sprayed from the tip of a brush <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Did that not calm your mind?</p><h4 id="4-Objects-Singing-Videos"><a href="#4-Objects-Singing-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4. Objects Singing Videos"></a>4. Objects Singing Videos</h4><p>One of the viral TikTok memes had several objects singing Adele’s hit number “ Someone Like You”. This could be something for you to base your ideas on for a new viral video. Use any object around the house, not even necessary that it should move about. The trick lies in finding the right song to pair with, something that will lend a soul to the object and give the impression of the performance coming from a real person.</p><p>See if <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1079418894538940418" >Pikachu and his orchestra can provide you with some inspiration <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="5-Art-Videos"><a href="#5-Art-Videos" class="headerlink" title="5. Art Videos"></a>5. Art Videos</h4><p>This one is for all the artists out there. If you are someone who creates figurines, pictures, or any other form of art, then don’t let your creative process go unnoticed – rather, film it and put it up as a Tik Tok video. The social media platform has many takers for such videos that show the process behind every creative job as it helps give a view into the thought process of an artist, however minute. This is also a good way for you to promote your work on social media, helping you gain greater exposure in the long run. Add some creative twists to these videos and help them stand out in the crowd.</p><p>Here is someone <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BxvZ78YHEUf/" >showing off their artistic skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="6-1-Minute-Recipes"><a href="#6-1-Minute-Recipes" class="headerlink" title="6.1-Minute Recipes"></a>6.1-Minute Recipes</h4><p>If you are a cooking aficionado and often dabble around in the kitchen for preparing new recipes, then TikTok is a good place to share your cooking videos. While fitting in the entire video into a matter of a few seconds can prove difficult, it is certainly not impossible. Skip the commentary and speed up the videos but make sure they are of self-explanatory nature. If cooking is not your thing, you can also post videos of what you eat every day – there is a sizable follower base for that category as well!</p><p>Chef Shereen will show you <a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cookingwithshereen/video/6841303083289464070" >how to cook a Santa Claus Melon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> here</p><h4 id="7-Animal-Videos"><a href="#7-Animal-Videos" class="headerlink" title="7. Animal Videos"></a>7. Animal Videos</h4><p>Oh, those amazing creations of the Almighty! When it comes to cute pet clips, there is very little you can go wrong with. Be it tricks, reaction to your singing, or simply them having a jolly good time, there is always a lot of attention on pets. If you have not done so already, it is time to capture the acts of your pets on camera and start pulling in the followers. The music needs to be as adorable as the pets themselves and make sure they are at ease doing what you ask them to do. The more authentic the reaction, the more attention your video will get. Use the shots where you get the sincerest reactions to come up with the most interesting clips.</p><p>Just look at this <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzLCv72DpcY/" >adorable little doggo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="8-Funny-TikTok-Ideas"><a href="#8-Funny-TikTok-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="8. Funny TikTok Ideas"></a>8. Funny TikTok Ideas</h4><p>Narrate funny stories with your twist in the narrative, few sources of entertainment can be as good! Even asking a simple question could count under this category. Don’t be dissuaded by the short time frame. You can also come up with your own stories about things you observed around you on a day-to-day basis. As long as you keep it hilarious, your fans will love it.</p><h4 id="9-Words-of-Positivity"><a href="#9-Words-of-Positivity" class="headerlink" title="9. Words of Positivity"></a>9. Words of Positivity</h4><p>You are sure to have a favorite song. How about tweaking the lyrics a bit to make it sound more current, something that fits in better with current sentiments? Love for the environment, gender diversity, anti-racism, are some of the genres you can work with. The more resounding your message, the more will be the views it generates. Ensure your new lyrics are in tune with the overall tempo of the song and focus on keeping it positive.</p><p>Here is someone <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1081608132382609413" >promoting respect for women <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="10-Challenges"><a href="#10-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="10.

It focuses on three classes of heroes―support, damage, and tank―inviting players to focus on specific roles.

Once you’ve created an account and accomplished this, you’ll be able to download the game itself. This might take a while as the game is fairly large but once complete you’ll be able to jump right in. The main menu will have a lot to look at, such as an option to view the different heroes and read about their abilities, which can be good to do<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-maps-in-overwatch-4126097" >before you start playing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/63laXnJxAlIsqKFf9Iy_Ht61Jfg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4048739-HeroHoriz-f006e20dae19441e8c667f43a4f0f232.jpg"                      alt="Overwatch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528688/16446" target="_top" id="1528688">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528688" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528688/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Plot-Not-provided-in-the-game-itself"><a href="#Plot-Not-provided-in-the-game-itself" class="headerlink" title="Plot: Not provided in the game itself"></a><strong>Plot: Not provided in the game itself</strong></h2><p> Overwatch itself doesn’t have much of a plot built into the game―but Blizzard has released animated shorts to let fans learn more about the game’s backstory. The general plot of the game takes place on a different earth. In the past, something called an “Omnic Crisis” occurred. Humans developed AI (Omnics) which grew into sentience. But when the same people who created these Omnics, started to create killer AI, the people came together to form Overwatch.</p><p> Overwatch is a task force created to destroy problematic AI. While this backstory and plot do exist, within the game itself, you don’t really get much of this information. What you’ll see is a variety of super beings who have special abilities, most of which are supported by sci-fi tech. But if you’re interested in knowing it all, be sure to catch up on the animated shorts.</p><h2 id="Modes-and-Competition-A-fun-and-flexible-variety-of-styles-and-heroes"><a href="#Modes-and-Competition-A-fun-and-flexible-variety-of-styles-and-heroes" class="headerlink" title="Modes and Competition: A fun and flexible variety of styles and heroes"></a><strong>Modes and Competition: A fun and flexible variety of styles and heroes</strong></h2><p> Overwatch has a few different game styles you can play. You’ll probably want to try quick play first—and if you’re looking to get into competitive gameplay, you’ll actually be required to play quick play until you reach a certain level. Quick play is the same as competitive, only there is no ranking system, so winning and losing comes with less pressure. That said, Overwatch is still built around measuring how well you do against other players, awarding medals if you do well, and even has a voting system after each map so people can tell you you’re good (or yell at you in chat if you’re doing badly).</p><p> A good team is important in Overwatch, requiring you to use mix of each class—a team of all damage isn’t going to be able to live long enough to make much of a break against a team with tanks and healers.</p><p> There are a few different game types within quick play: Assault, Control, Escort, and Hybrid. Assault involves taking control of two capture points, with one team attacking and one defending. Control is king-of-the-hill with both teams fighting to control a single capture point for a certain amount of time. In Escort, one team must move beside a cart, helping it across a map while the other team defends and tries to stop it. Hybrid mode is simply a combination of Assault and Escort, with at least one capture point and then a payload course after.</p><p> No matter the mode, teams are made up of six heroes. Heroes come in three classes: tank, support, or damage. A good team is important in Overwatch, requiring you to use a mix of each class—a team of all damage isn’t going to be able to live long enough to make much of a break against a team with tanks and healers. It is this idea of team balance that is such a huge part of Overwatch. A lot of that balance comes from players picking the heroes they are strongest with, and you do have some amount of flexibility to change to a different hero should the game warrant it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/geioFj1FYlUVuTIYb9JR3YauwGc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4048739-02-39f6f212190b4762a638be5f9fe9c1bf.jpg"                      alt="Overwatch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/1943648/22993" target="_top" id="1943648">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1943648" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://homestyler.sjv.io/i/5597632/1943648/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Specialization-Plenty-of-roles-to-pick-from"><a href="#Specialization-Plenty-of-roles-to-pick-from" class="headerlink" title="Specialization: Plenty of roles to pick from"></a><strong>Specialization: Plenty of roles to pick from</strong></h2><p> This idea of roles or “specializations” is part of what many players likely love about Overwatch—but it is also the biggest critique we have of the game. Most players are put into slots where they mainly play one type of class, and even within that class, often only a set of two or three heroes.</p><p> For example, one might main support and only play Lucio, Mercy, and Ana. This idea can be limiting, because after a certain point, you’re likely to get sick of the classes you’ve focused upon, and after investing so much time into those classes, it’s also a lot of work to move out of them and learn a whole new set. Not only that, but within competitive gameplay, people can be extremely mean if you aren’t playing a class you know, or aren’t performing as well as the other people you are playing with expect you to.</p><p> That said, Overwatch is amazing because of its variety of heroes. There are currently 30 to choose from, which means a lot of variety, unique abilities, and special ultimates. Whether you want to be a fast shooter that zips around, can rewind time and throws bombs, or a giant hamster that can turn into a ball, roll around, and smash things, there is something for everyone.</p><p> Beyond quick play and competitive, there is also an arcade mode, which rotates through different styles of gameplay. This can include capture-the-flag, Lucio ball, mystery heroes, 3 vs. 3 random heroes, and more. Arcade is the least competitive of any of the game modes, but can also be the most unpredictable.</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Fun-fast-and-balanced"><a href="#Gameplay-Fun-fast-and-balanced" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Fun, fast, and balanced"></a><strong>Gameplay: Fun, fast, and balanced</strong></h2><p> Whether you’re playing quick play, competitive match-making or arcade, the handling and gunplay in Overwatch is smooth. Movements feel responsive and solid, guns feel accurate, and hero abilities are unique with a direct and immediate impact on gameplay. Blizzard also does their best to keep things fresh, putting out<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-maps-in-overwatch-4126097" >new heroes and maps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> throughout the year, and keeping things balanced between the heroes. If you’re looking for a competitive game with an emphasis on team-play, Overwatch is a very well-made game.</p><p> Blizzard also does their best to keep things fresh, putting out new heroes and maps throughout the year, and keeping things balanced between the heroes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ax5pf76Q9l7kCaVmRsWVAyK3mKw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4048739-04-053ac15b2c4c4a50ad82b5b6a6b84e96.jpg"                      alt="Overwatch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144273/7443" target="_top" id="2144273">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144273" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144273/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-Stylized-beings-with-bright-colors"><a href="#Graphics-Stylized-beings-with-bright-colors" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Stylized beings with bright colors"></a><strong>Graphics: Stylized beings with bright colors</strong></h2><p> Overwatch has a unique look and feel, consisting of a mix of bright colors and mildly cartoony-looking characters. It works well for the game, which can sometimes feel visually chaotic, especially for new players. But the models are sleek looking, and each of the characters feels like it fits into the same world. Maps are also different and visually interesting, with lots of great details. On top of all this, Overwatch also offers a variety of skins and other in-game cosmetics. You can earn loot boxes by playing the game, or if you want, you can spend money and purchase specific skins. Overall, Overwatch is a graphically clean game, with a touch of artistic flair.</p><p> The models are sleek looking, and each of the characters feels like it fits into the same world.

Considering the amount of content in the game, and the replayability, Overwatch is worth the price. We’ve spent hundreds of hours playing the game, as the competitive nature could become addicting. There might come a point where it could become stressful. Ultimately, if you want to get the most out of Overwatch for the cost, it’s best to buy the game if you have friends who also want to play. You’ll have a lot more fun playing with people you know than playing with strangers on the internet. This might also help avoid some of the stress of the team-based online play.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983573">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983573.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983573">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983573.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983573%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983573/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Other-free-to-play-options"><a href="#Competition-Other-free-to-play-options" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other free-to-play options"></a><strong>Competition: Other free-to-play options</strong></h2><p> Overwatch is very reminiscent of Valve’s popular<a class="link"   href="http://www.teamfortress.com/" >Team Fortress 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but at this time, Team Fortress 2 is a much older game.

It does not just let you share your talent and creativity; you can also create a big fandom by having millions of followers. While the app has built-in presets and effects, the good news is that you can edit the videos using great computer software.

You can ask it to search for up to 10 results, set how far back it’ll search for links (day, week, month, year), and set a region.</p><p> When you give ChatGPT any prompt, it’ll conduct a web search and gather the results. Then, the extension automatically frames a revised prompt that includes those latest results and your original query, instructing ChatGPT to scan and include the results.</p><p> The final output from the AI thus gives you more up-to-date information, such as news summaries, sports statistics, weather reports and forecasts, and stock market updates.</p><p> You can customize the default revised prompt that WebChatGPT uses, but as a new user, we wouldn’t suggest that. Once you’re more accustomed to using this extension, feel free to look into options that improve your queries</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> WebChatGPT for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-advanced/lpfemeioodjbpieminkklglpmhlngfcn" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-chatgpt/" >Firefox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="2-ChatGPT-Prompt-Genius"><a href="#2-ChatGPT-Prompt-Genius" class="headerlink" title="2.

But those screenshots don’t show the prompts users have typed to make ChatGPT better. Like<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-google-search-tips-pdf/" >learning the best Google search operators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you need to know how to frame the right prompts for ChatGPT. And this extension can help.</p><p> ChatGPT Prompt Genius is like a cheatsheet for prompts to feed the AI. The extension gathers user-generated prompts for various functions and tasks through a<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/" >Subreddit community <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> With the extension, you can quickly run these in ChatGPT or filter them to browse through categories such as academic writing, business, learning, fun and games, fiction writing, non-fiction writing, programming, social media, speeches, scripts, etc.</p><p> The more you discover and import these prompts and customize them to your needs, the more you’ll learn how to write specific questions that ChatGPT can understand and answer.</p><p> You can curate and save your recently used prompts if you want to reuse them later. The extension lets you save entire chats with the ChatGPT AI as a PDF, PNG, or Markdown HTML file directly from the browser. You can also use custom themes for the chat interface, but that’s more about looks than function.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> ChatGPT Prompt Genius for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-history/jjdnakkfjnnbbckhifcfchagnpofjffo/" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatgpt-history/" >Firefox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="3-ChatGPT-Writer"><a href="#3-ChatGPT-Writer" class="headerlink" title="3.

ChatGPT Writer</h2><p> When someone sends a professional email your way for something like a meeting or a job opportunity, it’s bad form to reply with a one or two-line email (even if that sums up everything you want to say). ChatGPT Writer takes your intended reply and generates a long, professional-sounding email message.</p><p> The extension works with all email services but is specially primed for Gmail, offering a button next to<strong>Send</strong> in the<strong>Compose</strong> message box. When you fire up ChatGPT Writer, you’ll see the original email and find a box to enter what you want to reply briefly.</p><p> You can make it a simple and easy command; for example, “Write a reply to this email about my interest in the job and seek information about salary.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chatgpt-writer-1.jpg"                      alt="an email reply using chatgpt writer"                ></p><p> ChatGPT Writer will take a few seconds and then compose a long, professional message along those lines. You can change or edit any words within the box, or redo your prompt if it’s not satisfactory. When you’re happy with the result, insert it directly into the<strong>Reply</strong> box, and you’re ready to send it.</p><p> The first time you use ChatpGPT Writer, you’ll need to log in to your OpenAI account with it. The extension works with any Chromium browser such as Chrome, Brave, or Edge. While it’s currently best for replying to professional emails, you can also give it non-work prompts to write casual and personal email messages.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> ChatGPT Writer for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-writer-write-mail/pdnenlnelpdomajfejgapbdpmjkfpjkp/" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105867/7443" target="_top" id="2105867">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105867" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105867/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-YouTube-Summary-With-ChatGPT"><a href="#4-YouTube-Summary-With-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="4.

Many times, all you want is a transcript to quickly browse through what the video is going to say so that you can know if it’s worth your time.</p><p> Install YouTube Summary With ChatGPT and go to any video. The right sidebar now has a box for<strong>Transcript &amp; Summary</strong> , clicking which will open a time-stamped transcript of the video generated by ChatGPT.</p><p> Click any timestamp to be taken to that moment in the video. If you’re already midway through the video, you can jump to the current time in the transcript.

Clicking this takes you to ChatGPT, with the transcript already typed in the prompt.

But Google Chrome offers some excellent voice commands and text-to-speech features. Talk-to-ChatGPT bridges this gap to let you issue prompts by talking to your computer and having the ChatGPT answers read aloud by AI.</p><p> Once you install the extension, refresh the ChatGPT tab once, and press<strong>Start</strong> in the extension to allow access. A floating panel in the top-right of your screen shows whether it’s active or not, and you can toggle it to record, playback audio to read the answers or pause.</p><p> Talk-to-ChatGPT is an open-source extension that lets you fiddle around with the settings. You can choose from different AI voices, the voice pitch, and the speed at which text is read. It also supports voice command shortcuts of “Stop” and “Pause” to control playback.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Talk-to-ChatGPT for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/talk-to-chatgpt/hodadfhfagpiemkeoliaelelfbboamlk" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="6-ChatGPT-for-Search-Engines"><a href="#6-ChatGPT-for-Search-Engines" class="headerlink" title="6.

It also works with Bing, but you don’t need that anymore, given Microsoft has already officially integrated the two.</p><p> You’ll find the AI answers in the right sidebar next to regular search results.

But, like anything in tech, it carries an ugly side to it, too. The rise of fake news and misinformation, for instance, is one of its biggest unwanted by-products.</p><p> Perplexity AI can help you cut the misinformation out. Indeed, as the developers put it, the tool works as a combination of Google and ChatGPT. Simply type in your query in the extension and the tool will summarize you the best possible result—along with the legitimate cited sources. The last part here is very important.</p><p> While the tool summarizes the information in a neat manner, it ends the answers with a quick mention of the best, legitimate sources. And while there’s still a possibility of fault here (you’d still need to rely on the sources that Perplexity provides), we believe it’s much better than going in blind with the usual, source-less responses you’d otherwise gotten from ChatGPT.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Perplexity AI for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perplexity-ai-companion/hlgbcneanomplepojfcnclggenpcoldo" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148643/16836" target="_top" id="2148643">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148643" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="75"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148643/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ChatGPT-Is-Awesome-But-Be-Realistic…"><a href="#ChatGPT-Is-Awesome-But-Be-Realistic…" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT Is Awesome, But Be Realistic…"></a>ChatGPT Is Awesome, But Be Realistic…</h2><p> With these extensions including search results in ChatGPT, showing you how to use the right prompts, and using AI to improve YouTube or Gmail, you might think it’s time to offload a majority of your work to ChatGPT. But take a breath.</p><p> Yes, the AI capabilities are amazing compared to what has existed before this, but ChatGPT isn’t ready for prime-time yet. It still has a long way to go and depends largely upon the user keying in the right prompts. The data that it bases its answers on can also leave a lot to be desired in certain cases. For now, feel free to use it, but don’t rely wholly on it, and take those results with a pinch of salt.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-find-your-inner-peace-with-tiktoks-best-country-tracks/"><u>[Updated] Find Your Inner Peace with TikTok's Best Country Tracks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-safety-first-where-to-buy-followers-on-tiktok-responsibly/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Safety First Where to Buy Followers on TikTok Responsibly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-top-tips-for-effective-tiktok-usage-on-a-mac-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Top Tips for Effective TikTok Usage on a Mac for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-instagram-aesthetics-creating-charming-collages/"><u>2024 Approved Mastering Instagram Aesthetics Creating Charming Collages</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/engaging-audiences-through-snapbiz-campaigns/"><u>Engaging Audiences Through SnapBiz Campaigns</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-the-two-factor-authentication-on-iphone-15-plus-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Remove the Two Factor Authentication On iPhone 15 Plus</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-as-your-personal-assistant-for-work/"><u>How to Use ChatGPT as Your Personal Assistant for Work</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/ordered-viewing-of-the-conjuring-movies-for-maximum-horror-impact/"><u>Ordered Viewing of The 'Conjuring' Movies for Maximum Horror Impact</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/unlock-android-phone-if-you-forget-the-lava-yuva-3-pro-password-or-pattern-lock-by-drfone-android-unlock-android-unlock/"><u>Unlock android phone if you forget the Lava Yuva 3 Pro password or pattern lock</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The users range from influencers, individuals who use it for entertainment, and brands to gain authority and awareness. In 2020, most people spent their days at home, making its popularity explode.

The percentage of adults within the app is the most exciting part. All TikTok ads can reach other countries apart from American content. They can reach Asia and the Middle East as well undoubtedly.</p><p>Ads on the TikTok ad campaign offer excellent reach if you intend to work with an international audience.</p><p>The question now is who needs to invest in TikTok advertisement? Brands with a range of audiences may find TikTok is a better platform to test their campaigns. Ads in the TikTok app are better for the following:</p><ul><li>Brands that aim at marketing to customers aged 35 and below</li><li>Brands that target young women, especially those aged from18 to 25 years</li><li>Brands hoping to build a strong presence in Africa, the Middle East, or Asia</li></ul><h3 id="Types-of-TikTok-ads-TikTok-Brand-Campaigns"><a href="#Types-of-TikTok-ads-TikTok-Brand-Campaigns" class="headerlink" title="Types of TikTok ads&#x2F;TikTok Brand Campaigns"></a>Types of TikTok ads&#x2F;TikTok Brand Campaigns</h3><p>The below-mentioned best TikTok campaigns or ads are all kinds of successful TikTok campaigns that you will likely encounter while navigating through the TikTok app. The ads are limited, and not all can be accessed or seen in all areas.</p><h3 id="1-In-feed-ads"><a href="#1-In-feed-ads" class="headerlink" title="1.

Create Your TikTok Pixel and Events</strong></p><p>TikTok has an events manager tool to run TikTok ad campaigns that allow you to track activities and app events on your website, just as other social channels use a piece of code. The TikTok pixel integrates well with Google Tag Manager and Shopify. An option is also available to manually install the pixel in your website’s header.</p><p>Once the base code of pixel installs on your site, you will get prompted to set the event rules using either Developer Mode or Standard Mode. You can select any above methods based on your conversion and business path.</p><p><strong>2. Craft Custom Audiences and Create Lookalikes from Them</strong></p><p>Take a second to make custom audiences depending upon app or website activity and your customer lists once your pixel installs. After that, develop lookalikes of those audiences.</p><p>The similar will come in handy when you’re making target audiences for such campaigns, and you’ll be able to eliminate some of your groups of ads to allow better waste management.</p><p><strong>3. Create Target Audiences that Aren’t Too Small</strong></p><p>There are around 80 million TikTok users in the U.S. That’s a considerable number, though!</p><p>On TikTok, those same targeting parameters would yield an audience size of 35K monthly active users. So, you need to focus on a pretty large target audience and create a niche around them.</p><p><strong>4. Develop Video Ads Made with TikTok Trends in Mind</strong></p><p>You’re interrupting someone’s feed with a brand ad that the user didn’t ask for but got anyway. Your content should be captivating, designed with TikTok consumption in mind, and concise.</p><p><strong>5.

Though, to rival other apps like Instagram and TikTok, Snapchat has recently added a “Sound” feature. With this newly-added option, users can add music to a Snapchat video pretty easily and make their snaps more interesting. In this post, I’m going to let you know how to add music to a Snapchat video without any hassle. Let’s get it started and level-up your Snapchat game!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Sound-Feature-in-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Sound-Feature-in-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Sound Feature in Snapchat?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Sound Feature in Snapchat?</h2><p>Before we learn how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s quickly get to know about the “Sounds” feature of the app. If you have been using Instagram or TikTok, then you might be familiar with their music feature.</p><p>Similarly, in 2020, Snapchat has also included a Sound feature that lets us add music to our snaps (photos or videos). For this, you can integrate Snapchat with a streaming service like Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, or Soundcloud. While it doesn’t include all sorts of tracks, you can find most of the popular songs so that you can easily add music to a Snapchat video and make it interesting.</p><p>Once the other person would view your snap, they can hear the music playing in the background. If they want to listen to it or know more about the song, then they can just tap on its sticker on your snap.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130891/7443" target="_top" id="2130891">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130891" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130891/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video-on-iPhone-or-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video-on-iPhone-or-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add Music to a Snapchat Video on iPhone or Android?"></a>Part 2: How to Add Music to a Snapchat Video on iPhone or Android?</h2><p>One of the best things about Snapchat is that the overall interface of the app is pretty similar for both iOS and Android versions. Therefore, to learn how to add music on a Snapchat video, you need to follow the same process. As of now, you can find almost all the popular songs on Snapchat and can even record your own sounds.</p><p>To learn how to add music to your Snapchat video on your Android or iOS device, you can just follow this simple drill.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Visit the Snapchat Sound section on the app</strong></p><p>At first, just launch the Snapchat application on your device and tap on the camera icon from the home to start recording.</p><p>Using the rear or front camera of your device, you can now record any video on Snapchat. Once the video is recorded, you can tap on the music icon from the sidebar to add a song to a Snapchat video.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Search for any music to include in your Snaps</strong></p><p>As you would tap on the <strong>Music</strong> icon, you can view a list of various songs supported by Snapchat. If you want to look for anything specific, then just tap on the search icon and enter keywords to find a song of your choice.</p><p>Afterward, Snapchat will list the searched results, and you can tap on the play icon to first listen to the song. Just tap on the icon of the song and click on the “Next” button from the bottom to include it in the snap.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Trim and add the song to your Snapchat video</strong></p><p>Now, Snapchat will automatically display the snippet of the music at the bottom. You can use the left or the right slider option to trim the section of the music you want to add. Here, you also can tap on the play icon to listen to the track first.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Add music to your Snapchat video after recording</strong></p><p>That’s it! Once you have trimmed the music snippet, you can post it. You can tap on the shutter or the download icon first to save the video on your phone.</p><p>Now, you can preview the music via its sticker. You can just tap on the music sticker to change its appearance or drag it on the screen to place it anywhere you like. To change its size, you can just pinch-in or pinch-out the sticker.</p><p>In the end, just tap on the send icon to post your snap. You can add it to your story or sent it to any Snapchat contact. When they would open it, they can listen to the added song and even tap on the sticker to load it.</p><p>In this way, anyone can learn how to put music on a Snapchat video without any hassle.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135407/19272" target="_top" id="2135407">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135407" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135407/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-FAQs-on-Adding-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video"><a href="#Part-3-FAQs-on-Adding-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: FAQs on Adding Music to a Snapchat Video"></a>Part 3: FAQs on Adding Music to a Snapchat Video</h2><p>Now when you know how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s clear some common doubts related to it.</p><ul><li><strong>How to add your own music to a Snapchat video?</strong></li></ul><p>Apart from the available songs on Snapchat, the app also lets us add the sound of our choice. For this, just click on the music icon and tap the “Create Sound” button instead. This will let you record anything or create your own music on Snapchat.</p><ul><li><strong>Why are some songs not available on Snapchat?</strong></li></ul><p>The Sound feature of Snapchat only provides licensed music by collaborating with some of the biggest record labels. Therefore, while you can find most of the popular songs, chances are that some of them might be missing from the collection.</p><ul><li><strong>Why can’t I add music to my Snapchat videos?</strong></li></ul><p>Well, there could be two possible reasons for this – you might be using an old version of Snapchat or the feature might not be available in your region yet. To fix this, you can just go to the Snapchat page on the App&#x2F;Play Store and tap on the “Update” button. Furthermore, if the Sound feature has not been rolled out to your region, then you can just wait for a while.</p><p>As you can see, it is pretty easy to learn how to add music to a Snapchat video like a pro. With the newly-added Sounds feature, it is pretty easy to add a song to your Snapchat videos and make them more interesting. Go ahead and try this feature to make your snaps creative and share this guide with others to teach them how do you add music to a Snapchat video as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105866/7443" target="_top" id="2105866">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105866" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105866/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-best-mp3-extractors-from-tiktok-online-and-at-zero-price/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Best MP3 Extractors From TikTok - Online & at Zero Price</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-cut-the-clutter-structuring-videos-with-chapter-tags/"><u>[New] Cut the Clutter Structuring Videos with Chapter Tags</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-expand-your-reach-effective-business-tactics-on-tiktok-for-2024/"><u>[New] Expand Your Reach Effective Business Tactics on TikTok for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-anime-inspired-shorts-top-20-trends-on-tiktok/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Anime-Inspired Shorts Top 20 Trends on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-cutting-edge-recording-nintendo-switch-edition/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Cutting-Edge Recording Nintendo Switch Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-hdr-editing-essentials-for-pc-users/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, HDR Editing Essentials for PC Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-speedy-tiktok-video-creation-a-comprehensible-guide-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Speedy TikTok Video Creation A Comprehensible Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/3-facts-you-need-to-know-about-screen-mirroring-vivo-y100i-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>3 Facts You Need to Know about Screen Mirroring Vivo Y100i | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/best-methods-for-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-pro-5g-wont-turn-on-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Best Methods for Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G Wont Turn On | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/beyond-fun-and-games-deciphering-the-deep-meanings-in-emojis/"><u>Beyond Fun & Games Deciphering the Deep Meanings in Emojis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-use-life360-on-windows-pc-for-oneplus-nord-n30-se-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Use Life360 on Windows PC For OnePlus Nord N30 SE? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-location-on-facebook-dating-for-your-samsung-galaxy-a14-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Change Location On Facebook Dating for your Samsung Galaxy A14 4G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/minimizing-game-bars-operations-for-windows-11-privacy/"><u>Minimizing Game Bar's Operations for Windows 11 Privacy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-features-of-the-apc-back-ups-pro-1500va-generous-power-supply-extensive-socket-availability-and-battery-replacement-overview/"><u>Unveiling the Features of the APC Back-UPS Pro 1500VA: Generous Power Supply, Extensive Socket Availability & Battery Replacement Overview</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Download Video Star App"></a>1. Download Video Star App</h4><p>Choosing a location, mounting your iPhone on a tripod, or picking the positions for each of your clones are all important steps you’ll need to take before you actually start recording. There are several apps that enable you to create clone videos easily, but in this article, we are going to show you how you can clone yourself with Video Star. The app can be downloaded from the App Store for free, but additional in-app purchases are necessary if you want to have access to all the power packs Video Star offers. You don’t have to record the video clips with this app since the iPhone’s native camera app is powerful enough to enable you to record high-quality footage.</p><h4 id="2-Edit-Multiple-Video-Clips"><a href="#2-Edit-Multiple-Video-Clips" class="headerlink" title="2. Edit Multiple Video Clips"></a>2. Edit Multiple Video Clips</h4><p>After you record all the positions for your next clone video with the iPhone’s native camera app, you should cut the video clips and keep only the parts where you are perfectly positioned, so your position in one clip doesn’t overlap with other positions. During the video recording process try to create as much separation between two positions in order to avoid any chance of overlapping. One of the best ways to achieve this is to shoot at a location that is spacious enough so you can make enough separation between two positions. Keep in mind that the maximum number of clips you can combine in the Video Star app is limited to just three, so if you want to have more than three clones in the shot you first have to piece together three clips, save them as a single file and then add more clips to the cloned video you created.</p><h4 id="3-Level-up-Your-Videos-with-Video-Star"><a href="#3-Level-up-Your-Videos-with-Video-Star" class="headerlink" title="3. Level up Your Videos with Video Star"></a>3. Level up Your Videos with Video Star</h4><p>Video Star also enables you to shoot your videos from the app, and you can adjust the Countdown before the app starts recording or the Recording Speed. Make sure to enter the lowest Recording Speed value possible, because that way you’ll be recording like TikTok does on fast.</p><p>Tap the Record button, then select the Multiple options, and play the video that contains the song you previously selected. Once you reach the spot in the song where you want to introduce the clone simply tap Set, so the recording will stop at the designated point and you can move to another position. If at any point during recording you realize that your movements extend to your clone’s location, you can simply tap on the hamburger icon and select the Delete Last option.</p><p>To preview the video, you just have to tap on the Scissors icon, and the recorded video will automatically start playing. The Record New Clip in the Scissors menu lets you start from the beginning in case you’re not happy with the results or you can use this option to start recording the video with the second position of your clone.</p><p>When done, head back to the Scissors menu, and tap on the Multi-Layer Clip. This feature doesn’t come with the free version of the app, and you must purchase it in order to create a clone video. This action will enable you to select the back and front clips. After selecting the clips, the Mask Front menu will appear on the screen, choose the Shape option and use the hamburger icon on the right side of the screen to change the video’s shape to Rectangle. Drag the rectangle in the preview window so you can crop the first clip to match the demands of your video and press the Next icon to continue the video editing process.</p><p>Alternatively, you can use the Erase option to remove the unwanted parts of each video. You can find this option in the Mask Front or Mask Back menu, so just select it and use your finger to remove sections of the shot you don’t want to use.</p><p>The Add Effect menu will pop up on the screen so you can add different effects to your first video clip, and then repeat the entire process for the back clip. Once you’ve edited the second clip tap on the Create button to complete the process of making a multilayer clip. Tap Done to save the clip to your camera roll, and upload it to TikTok.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068407/7443" target="_top" id="2068407">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068407" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Cloning yourself in a video using the Video Star app is a simple process that can be mastered in a short period of time.

This mini-PC houses a Ryzen 7 8845HS processor with up to 64 GB of RAM and a 1 TB M.2 NVMe 2280 SSD in the body of a Tesla Cybertruck. The company is likely not calling it that name due to copyright infringement, but its mini-PC is an almost faithful representation of the real thing.</p><p> The Cybertruck mini-PC creatively hides its ports in the rear bumper, where you get a DC-in jack for power, a USA 3.1 Gen 1 Type-A port, a single HDMI 2.1 port, two USB 3.1 Gen Type-C ports with PD3.0, and a 3.5 mm combo jack. The SSD slot is also easily accessible from the underbody of the mini-PC, but you need to do a complete teardown if you want to upgrade your RAM.</p><p> But aside from the electronics inside the Xyber XPC, you also get a lot in the form of the Cybertruck body that sits on top of the frame that holds the motherboard. It appears to be made from a cast magnesium frame, giving it a solid feel. The doors and the tailgate on the Cybertruck also open, with the latter featuring a built-in ramp. It’s unfortunate, though, that it doesn’t have the retractable tonneau cover.</p><p> Image 1 of 3</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Xyber Team XPC internals"                ></p><p> Xyber Team XPC internals  (Image credit: Taki Udon &#x2F; YouTube)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Xyber Team XPC ports"                ></p><p> Xyber Team XPC ports  (Image credit: Taki Udon &#x2F; YouTube)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Xyber Team XPC front"                ></p><p> Xyber Team XPC front  (Image credit: Taki Udon &#x2F; YouTube)</p><p> The plastic frame that holds the motherboard is also well-crafted and detailed, including the seats, plastic wheels, and rubber tires. A daughter board inside the frunk of this funky little mini-PC Cybertruck controls the front and rear lights, and you can steer the truck’s front wheel, albeit by pushing the wheels left or right with your fingers.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> We noticed that the Xyber XPC Mini Desktop Computer has a USB Type-A port under the front of the truck. We don’t know what it is for, but it would be funny if you could repurpose it to power the truck if you add a battery, like how the Apple Magic Mouse still recharges today. The mini-PC Cybertruck also has an allocation for built-in speakers, but the sample we saw doesn’t have one.</p><p> This Stealth Cybertruck PC Can Game - YouTube <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/1DJs6fIS4Pg/maxresdefault.jpg"                      alt="This Stealth Cybertruck PC Can Game - YouTube"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://youtu.be/1DJs6fIS4Pg" >Watch On <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Although the Xyber XPC has many vents for cooling, it still hits 100 degrees C with the fans going full tilt when set to its maximum 60-watt TDP. But with the TDP lowered to 30 watts, the CPU’s peak temperature is now just 60 degrees Celsius, and the fans are barely audible.</p><p> We don’t have pricing information yet about the Xyber XPC, though, as it’s still in the campaign pre-launch stage. But the team behind the mini-PC Cybertruck says that they’re optimizing the BIOS and OS to get the best performance out of this small desktop computer.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p> We’d love to get on this mini-PC Cybertruck and run it at its pace.

One of the fun easy to use apps is Tik Tok that came out in 2016. It’s a very versatile app that can easily push up your video making game and the best part about it is that you do not even need to be professional. The Tik Tok app has become extremely popular all over the world. You can follow people worldwide and also gain popularity easily if you get a good amount of followers. We will give you information on how to use it and discuss its different features.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Everything about Vigo Video You Should Know <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Music-Video-via-Tik-Tok"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Music-Video-via-Tik-Tok" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Music Video via Tik Tok?"></a>How to Create a Music Video via Tik Tok?</h2><p> This app allows you to make music videos directly within the app. It is very user-friendly and as most of us have a knack of using snapchat and Instagram, one can easily figure out how to use it, but if you still face difficulty we are here to fix it. If you are facing problems as to how to make a Tik Tok music video, first off you need to learn how to record it.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p> There is a prominent plus sign button in the middle of the screen. You can press and hold that button just like on snapchat for as long as your desire to make your video. There is also a handsfree feature available on the right side of the screen in the shape of a clock. The timer will start and your video will automatically start recording.</p><p> Once you are done with that, there is a “pick soundtrack” option that comes on the top of your screen from which you can pick the song of your liking from the wide variety of songs available in the Tik Tok music album.

Just keep reading.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-Free-Followers-on-TikTok"><a href="#How-to-Get-Free-Followers-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Free Followers on TikTok?"></a>How to Get Free Followers on TikTok?</h2><p>Creating short music videos and posting them online, demands a lot of work because you have to select the song you’re going to use, capture the footage perfectly and edit it before you can share a video on your TikTok profile. Throughout all of the stages of this process, there are things you can do that can help you attract a broad audience, so let’s take a look at some of the best ways to increase the reach of your videos.</p><h4 id="1-Follow-and-Unfollow-the-Most-Popular-Musers"><a href="#1-Follow-and-Unfollow-the-Most-Popular-Musers" class="headerlink" title="1. Follow and Unfollow the Most Popular Musers"></a>1. Follow and Unfollow the Most Popular Musers</h4><p>This is a simple and effective way to gain the attention of TikTok’s most influential users. Pinpoint the most successful Musers in your niche and follow and unfollow them until they follow you back. Although it may seem silly, this strategy actually works, because, after enough attempts, your favorite members of the platform will look at your profile, and follow you back if they like what they see. Try to comment on their videos, because TikTok stars share on their profiles can potentially increase the chances of being followed back, especially if your comments are always on point. Some of the people whose work you appreciate maybe even willing to share their secrets and help you get more followers.</p><h4 id="2-Make-Your-Profile-Look-Charming"><a href="#2-Make-Your-Profile-Look-Charming" class="headerlink" title="2. Make Your Profile Look Charming"></a>2. Make Your Profile Look Charming</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/charming-profile-on-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Charming Profile on TikTok"                ></p><p>Every little detail matters when it comes to optimizing your profile. The profile picture, username, or the personal information you provide can all leave a strong impression on people who visit your profile. A long username that is hard to remember isn’t going to help you gain more recognition, mostly because everyone is going to forget it soon after they hear it. Pick a short and catchy username that stands out and try avoiding using different usernames on different social media accounts. Let others know what types of videos they can expect from you by mentioning that you love making fitness videos, vlogs, or simple music videos in which you showcase your singing talents. However, it is also indispensable to be as specific as you can, so besides saying that you’re producing fitness videos, it’s also helpful if you mention that you’re making yoga or aerobics videos. Your profile is the first step to establishing communication with new followers, which is why it is important to do everything you can to encourage others to hit the follow button and start communicating with you.</p><h4 id="3-Participate-in-Viral-Challenges"><a href="#3-Participate-in-Viral-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="3. Participate in Viral Challenges"></a>3. Participate in Viral Challenges</h4><p>Following the latest social media trends is necessary because it enables you to see what other types of content are popular at the moment. Viral challenges, like the recent Kiki challenge, often involve singing and dancing to a popular song, which is why they are a great choice of content for the TikTok platform that is mostly dedicated to music videos. Using trending hashtags in the posts you share on your profile will make your viral challenge videos visible to millions of people, and it can increase your number of followers drastically in just a few days. In addition, a challenge can inspire you to explore a specific topic or a music genre further and help you build an easily recognizable style that can expand the size of your fanbase.</p><h4 id="4-Post-Your-Videos-on-Other-Social-Networks"><a href="#4-Post-Your-Videos-on-Other-Social-Networks" class="headerlink" title="4. Post Your Videos on Other Social Networks"></a>4. Post Your Videos on Other Social Networks</h4><p>Don’t limit yourself to just one social media account because if you do so, you won’t be able to reach the audiences on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. Facebook alone has 2 billion active users each month, while the size of the audience on YouTube isn’t much smaller. Managing accounts on several social networks under the same name is also an effective way to build your online reputation because people will remember the name they saw on one platform. As a result, they will start following you on the other. Posting music and all various types of videos on multiple social media accounts also means that they are going to be shared by a larger number of people.</p><h4 id="5-Don’t-Hesitate-to-Collaborate-with-Others"><a href="#5-Don’t-Hesitate-to-Collaborate-with-Others" class="headerlink" title="5. Don’t Hesitate to Collaborate with Others"></a>5. Don’t Hesitate to Collaborate with Others</h4><p>Being a one-man or a one-woman show doesn’t always pay off, especially if you’re just starting out. Recording a duo with an equally talented friend or making any other type of collab video can have a positive impact on the size of your fanbase. It is important to choose the people you work with carefully because content creators that already have a lot of followers might not be interested in collaborating with you if the number of followers you have is significantly lower than theirs. The people you choose to work with should also share your passion for the type of video you’re hoping to create since there is no point in inviting someone to make a comedy video with you if their main interest is in fashion. After selecting the person, you’re going to collaborate with. You can use the TikTok’s Duet option that offers an easy way to create a music video with someone who shares your taste in music.</p><h4 id="6-Use-Video-Editing-Apps-to-Make-Impressive-Videos"><a href="#6-Use-Video-Editing-Apps-to-Make-Impressive-Videos" class="headerlink" title="6. Use Video Editing Apps to Make Impressive Videos"></a>6. Use Video Editing Apps to Make Impressive Videos</h4><p>All videos, regardless of how short they are, benefit from the video editing process. You don’t have to use professional <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut to edit the videos you share on TikTok, because some other video editing apps offer more eye-catching filters and effects to make a captivating short music video. One of them is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The TikTok app enables you to remove all unwanted parts of the video clips you recorded, and it also features a rich library of visual effects, but it lacks some more advanced video editing options. If you’d like to create the ghost effect or to clone yourself using apps such as Video Star, Triller or MuStar is a much better option, because they offer a wider range of video editing tools than TikTok. You can also learn more user-created content from <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >User Gallery <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to empower video creation.</p><p>Free download Filmora now and make yourself a superstar on TikTok.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902304/19272" target="_top" id="1902304">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902304" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902304/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-apple.svg"                      alt="iOS"                ></a> <a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-google.svg"                      alt="Android"                > </a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="7-Be-Unique-and-Innovative"><a href="#7-Be-Unique-and-Innovative" class="headerlink" title="7. Be Unique and Innovative"></a>7. Be Unique and Innovative</h4><p>Find your own voice, because everyone else’s voice is already taken. If you try to imitate the content other creators produce, you’ll never find your own distinctive style. What’s more, the viewers of your video can easily see if you’re really enjoying making the video or not, and in many cases, that may be the reason why they decide to skip hitting the follow button. Chose topics that you’re passionate about because if you’re just following the trends, the content you produce may seem generic. Don’t be afraid to think out of the box and do something new every once in a while. Just to see how your followers react. More often than not, you’ll discover something your fans adore, and you’ll attract new followers that liked your eagerness to try out new things.</p><h4 id="8-Keep-Things-Short-and-Concise"><a href="#8-Keep-Things-Short-and-Concise" class="headerlink" title="8. Keep Things Short and Concise"></a>8. Keep Things Short and Concise</h4><p>It is not possible to record videos with the TikTok app that last longer than sixty seconds. Therefore, sticking to the one-minute limit is probably the best way to ensure that your followers watch all videos you post on your account from the beginning until the end. There is no time limit for videos you upload to your account, so you can use your phone’s camera app to make videos that are longer than one minute. However, you should tread carefully since the longer duration of a video can discourage viewers from watching the entire video. Producing short music videos can be a challenging task, but it is also a great way to showcase your creativity and inspire others to follow your work.</p><h4 id="9-You’re-Entertainer-Act-Like-One"><a href="#9-You’re-Entertainer-Act-Like-One" class="headerlink" title="9. You’re Entertainer, Act Like One"></a>9. You’re Entertainer, Act Like One</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/entertainer-on-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Entertainer on TikTok"                ></p><p>How can you expect others to have fun while watching your videos, if you don’t have fun making them? Be spontaneous, and enjoy your time in front of the camera. That way you can always keep the spectator guessing what you’re going to do next. Put on a good show, that will leave the viewers of your videos wanting to see more. You can accomplish this by adding a lot of humor to the video or by simply enjoying the moment and going with the flow. Even though there are no recipes to the success of the content you post on the TikTok platform, focusing on your performance while remembering to be funny at times is going to help you increase the number of followers.</p><h4 id="10-Post-New-Content-At-Magic-Hours"><a href="#10-Post-New-Content-At-Magic-Hours" class="headerlink" title="10. Post New Content At Magic Hours"></a>10. Post New Content At Magic Hours</h4><p>Sharing new content at least twice a day will eventually get you a massive following, because it will improve the exposure your videos are getting, but you also have to post videos at the right time. The magic posting hours on TikTok are between 11 am and 5 pm as your followers and their friends are most likely to use the app in that time frame. Get to know your audience and try to understand how frequently and at which hours they’re using the TikTok app. This will help you create a posting schedule that minimizes the chances of posting videos during parts of the day when they get the least amount of exposure.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Be different, be unique, and provide high-quality entertainment to your followers. Try to offer something fresh that will sweep your audience off their feet. The TikTok app features a nearly endless supply of music and video editing options that enable you to express your creativity freely. However, just producing great videos is not enough to attract large audiences since you also have to employ your marketing skills if you want to grow your fanbase.

The new<a class="link"   href="https://www.minisforum.com/page/x7ti/index.html?lang=en" >AtomMan X7 Ti <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> becomes the first in the firm’s AtomMan line, described as a high-end cutting-edge marque by Minisforum. It is also claimed to be the “first Intel Ultra 9 AI Mini PC with a 4-inch Touchscreen.” With the rising popularity of<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cooling/hands-on-lian-lis-lcd-screen-fans-turn-heads-and-are-surprisingly-affordable-but-not-as-configurable-as-id-like" >extra screens in PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , integrating one into a compact desktop might be a popular idea.</p><p> Starting from the outside, we see that the AtomMan X7 Ti would be a conventional-looking<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/asus-gets-license-to-make-intel-nucs" >NUC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -alike apart from two things. Firstly, it features a 4-inch 480p touch display which covers a fair portion of the top panel. Secondly, it comes with a neat stand that angles the display panel into an easy glanceable view. Furthermore, Minisforum has followed some logic by situating a 1080p<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-hello-fido2-certification-may-update-microsoft,39261.html" >Windows Hello <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> compatible webcam and dual mics above the touchscreen, appealing to video conferencing fans.</p><p> While we are considering external features, let’s look at the ports. Despite its compact size (145 x 145 x 49mm), the AtomMan X7 Ti features a decent quantity and selection of ports, as follows: RJ45 5G Ethernet Port ×2, DP 2.0, HDMI 2.1,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/worlds-first-oculink-usb-4-egpu-with-radeor-rx-7600m-xt" >OCulink <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Port (up to 64Gbps), USB4 ×2, USB3.2 Gen2 Type-A ×2, USB3.2 Gen1 Type-A, USB2.0, a 3.5mm Combo Jack, SD Card slot, and a Power Button with an embedded fingerprint reader. <a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/wi-fi-7-faq" >Wi-Fi 7 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Bluetooth 5.4 complement the dual Ethernet ports. It must also be noted that the mix of dedicated monitor and USB4 ports means you can connect up to four external displays to this machine.</p><p> Image 1 of 3</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan X7 Ti PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan X7 Ti PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan X7 Ti PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p> Moving inside, the star of the show is the new Intel Core Ultra 9 processor<a class="link"   href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/236849/intel-core-ultra-9-processor-185h-24m-cache-up-to-5-10-ghz/specifications.html" >185H <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with a 16C&#x2F;22T CPU running at up to 5.1 GHz, and onboard Arc GPU with eight Xe cores running at up to 2.35 GHz.

It uses standard DDR5-5600 SO-DIMMs, up to a max of 64GB. There are also two M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 SSD slots, and the aforementioned wireless functionality comes courtesy of a socketed Intel BE200 card, so it can be changed for repair or upgrade.</p><p> We don’t have pricing for the AtomMan X7 Ti.

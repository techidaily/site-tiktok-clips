TikTok now seems to be a part of everyone’s life through the most popular lip-syncing videos, one-act dance routines, 1-min recipes, funny clips, and stuff like the bottle cap challenge.</p><p>More or less the heart and soul of today’s teenagers and young adults, and sometimes even senior citizens, TikTok now has over 1 billion users and became the World’s 7th most downloaded app, all within a span of 3years since its release in 2016.</p><p>What started with fun and games has become a serious platform to showcase one’s talent and gain followers, earn money, and even stardom. Such provisions have stirred fierce competition among influencers, for what seems like the Wars of Creativity to publish more and more viral-worthy videos.</p><p>If you are an influencer looking for new and amazing <strong>TikTok ideas</strong> to make your videos go viral, then here is a stimulus.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: TikTok vs YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers</a></li></ul><h2 id="TikTok-vs-YouTube"><a href="#TikTok-vs-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="TikTok vs YouTube"></a>TikTok vs YouTube</h2><p>TikTok may be one of a kind, but it is not the only platform where you can publish your mobile-made videos without much ado. The protagonist of that story is still, YouTube. TikTok being a game-changer in the scene, is giving maximum competition to all other social networks and digital platforms that deal with video-sharing, such as Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. But the tiff between YouTube and TikTok surpasses all other competitions because only these two are all about Videos.</p><h4 id="Nature-of-Content"><a href="#Nature-of-Content" class="headerlink" title="Nature of Content"></a>Nature of Content</h4><p>The main difference between YouTube and TikTok is the nature of the content. YouTube is a broader spectrum than TikTok, for it contains feature-length movies, episodes of off-air Television Series, music videos, podcasts, and personal videos is just a part of it. But TikTok revolves around short video clips. And just that.</p><h4 id="User-Base"><a href="#User-Base" class="headerlink" title="User Base"></a>User Base</h4><p>TikTok has a niche user base, with the majority of users between 16 and 25 yo. Meanwhile, YouTube reserves a universal user base, catering to people of all ages and from different walks of life.</p><h4 id="Outreach"><a href="#Outreach" class="headerlink" title="Outreach"></a>Outreach</h4><p>TikTok is primarily a casual, youth-centric platform. While it is useful for highlighting one’s talent and engaging a loyal fanbase, it is not ideal for business promotion, or to present a show in a traditional way, which is a substantial offering of YouTube. But on the flip side, due to the vastness of YouTube, short and casual videos like the ones typically available in TikTok, have limited scope to go viral.</p><p>Therefore, the difference between TikTok and YouTube is like Apples and Oranges. They are both fruits and are sweet. But are different species with different tastes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134223/18498" target="_top" id="2134223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134223/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers"><a href="#Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers"></a>Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers</h2><h4 id="1-Music-Videos"><a href="#1-Music-Videos" class="headerlink" title="1. Music Videos"></a>1. Music Videos</h4><p>A common theme of most viral TikTok videos is they tend to be cute and cuddly. As part of music videos, you are required to imitate certain adorable songs by performing their actions either using your hands or by putting your whole body into action. These songs can be typically found in the trending section of the app and it does not take much effort to figure out the ones that are high in popularity. The catch here is that you need to be among the frontrunners in terms of covering these songs so that you can find yourself a large captive audience to influence at the earliest.</p><p>Here is an example of <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsPbFnhZQ/" >a girl showing off her TikTok music video skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2-Dance-Videos"><a href="#2-Dance-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2. Dance Videos"></a>2. Dance Videos</h4><p>If it is short, funny, and uses the correct hashtags, your dance video can create a lot of influence among your followers. Oh, and don’t forget to pair them up with the correct background score. A song that is already trending and popular on the social platform will only boost your video’s chances of a hit. A short and easy dance always does the business, even better if it can be used for a meme.</p><p>This is a good example of what <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsN-RFmQn/" >your dance video should look like <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Now isn’t that the perfect ingredient for the next viral meme on the market!</p><h4 id="3-Calming-Videos"><a href="#3-Calming-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Calming Videos"></a>3. Calming Videos</h4><p>Just because it’s a TikTok video doesn’t mean that it has to be over-the-top and loud. Sometimes, keeping things simple is the secret to success. Calming videos are those where something that most would otherwise consider weird or mundane exerts a feeling of calm on the viewer. Most social media platforms have helped such videos gain immense popularity but finding the right explanation of what these pertain to is a pretty difficult task.</p><p>Look at this video of <a class="link"   href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/705446729114378862/" >color droplets being sprayed from the tip of a brush <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Did that not calm your mind?</p><h4 id="4-Objects-Singing-Videos"><a href="#4-Objects-Singing-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4. Objects Singing Videos"></a>4. Objects Singing Videos</h4><p>One of the viral TikTok memes had several objects singing Adele’s hit number “ Someone Like You”. This could be something for you to base your ideas on for a new viral video. Use any object around the house, not even necessary that it should move about. The trick lies in finding the right song to pair with, something that will lend a soul to the object and give the impression of the performance coming from a real person.</p><p>See if <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1079418894538940418" >Pikachu and his orchestra can provide you with some inspiration <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="5-Art-Videos"><a href="#5-Art-Videos" class="headerlink" title="5. Art Videos"></a>5. Art Videos</h4><p>This one is for all the artists out there. If you are someone who creates figurines, pictures, or any other form of art, then don’t let your creative process go unnoticed – rather, film it and put it up as a Tik Tok video. The social media platform has many takers for such videos that show the process behind every creative job as it helps give a view into the thought process of an artist, however minute. This is also a good way for you to promote your work on social media, helping you gain greater exposure in the long run. Add some creative twists to these videos and help them stand out in the crowd.</p><p>Here is someone <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BxvZ78YHEUf/" >showing off their artistic skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="6-1-Minute-Recipes"><a href="#6-1-Minute-Recipes" class="headerlink" title="6.1-Minute Recipes"></a>6.1-Minute Recipes</h4><p>If you are a cooking aficionado and often dabble around in the kitchen for preparing new recipes, then TikTok is a good place to share your cooking videos. While fitting in the entire video into a matter of a few seconds can prove difficult, it is certainly not impossible. Skip the commentary and speed up the videos but make sure they are of self-explanatory nature. If cooking is not your thing, you can also post videos of what you eat every day – there is a sizable follower base for that category as well!</p><p>Chef Shereen will show you <a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cookingwithshereen/video/6841303083289464070" >how to cook a Santa Claus Melon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> here</p><h4 id="7-Animal-Videos"><a href="#7-Animal-Videos" class="headerlink" title="7. Animal Videos"></a>7. Animal Videos</h4><p>Oh, those amazing creations of the Almighty! When it comes to cute pet clips, there is very little you can go wrong with. Be it tricks, reaction to your singing, or simply them having a jolly good time, there is always a lot of attention on pets. If you have not done so already, it is time to capture the acts of your pets on camera and start pulling in the followers. The music needs to be as adorable as the pets themselves and make sure they are at ease doing what you ask them to do. The more authentic the reaction, the more attention your video will get. Use the shots where you get the sincerest reactions to come up with the most interesting clips.</p><p>Just look at this <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzLCv72DpcY/" >adorable little doggo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="8-Funny-TikTok-Ideas"><a href="#8-Funny-TikTok-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="8. Funny TikTok Ideas"></a>8. Funny TikTok Ideas</h4><p>Narrate funny stories with your twist in the narrative, few sources of entertainment can be as good! Even asking a simple question could count under this category. Don’t be dissuaded by the short time frame. You can also come up with your own stories about things you observed around you on a day-to-day basis. As long as you keep it hilarious, your fans will love it.</p><h4 id="9-Words-of-Positivity"><a href="#9-Words-of-Positivity" class="headerlink" title="9. Words of Positivity"></a>9. Words of Positivity</h4><p>You are sure to have a favorite song. How about tweaking the lyrics a bit to make it sound more current, something that fits in better with current sentiments? Love for the environment, gender diversity, anti-racism, are some of the genres you can work with. The more resounding your message, the more will be the views it generates. Ensure your new lyrics are in tune with the overall tempo of the song and focus on keeping it positive.</p><p>Here is someone <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1081608132382609413" >promoting respect for women <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="10-Challenges"><a href="#10-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="10. Challenges"></a>10. Challenges</h4><p>Social media challenges such as the Ice Bucket Challenge usually never fail to go viral. So, if you are looking to boost your follower base, go ahead and take up a trending challenge and post it on TikTok. You may create your challenge and set trends for others to follow.</p><p>Here is an interesting challenge that even had <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv90UabzuBM" >US Senator Elizabeth Warren chipping in <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>These are some of the inspirational ideas that you can consider for coming up with winning content for your TikTok followers.

In case you wish to go viral, you need to create enough content for people to notice you. If you would like to create a low-profile, your profile might not appear often in the user’s feed.</p><p>The top accounts release videos several times every day. However, this level of production might be difficult for one person without compromising on the video’s quality. So, upload at least one video every day.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1815679/21290" target="_top" id="1815679">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1815679" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://versadesk.pxf.io/i/5597632/1815679/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Make-Sure-the-Videos-are-of-High-Quality"><a href="#2-Make-Sure-the-Videos-are-of-High-Quality" class="headerlink" title="2.

Hence, you have to make sure that you are sharing footage of top-notch quality. Yes, you might have to upload videos daily, but that doesn’t mean you should sacrifice quality for quantity. For this, however, you don’t have to employ a professional camera operator. You can create videos using your smartphone and then edit them using good software. This ensures that you make videos that will go viral. You can use an external microphone if the sound is an essential component.</p><h3 id="3-Do-Not-Ignore-Sounds"><a href="#3-Do-Not-Ignore-Sounds" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Not Ignore Sounds"></a>3. Do Not Ignore Sounds</h3><p>One of the primary differences of TikTok has been the liberty that it gives you to use music in the videos that people are sharing. It is incredibly easy to add music to your 15-seconds video on this platform. TikTok has made arrangements with the top music companies to get permission to use the copyrighted music extracts.</p><p>You will be able to add music tracks to your videos without any hassle from the app itself.</p><h3 id="4-Use-Trending-Hashtags-to-Keep-Up-with-the-Trends"><a href="#4-Use-Trending-Hashtags-to-Keep-Up-with-the-Trends" class="headerlink" title="4.

It is better to emulate some posts which you see on the ‘Discover’ page if you want the videos to trend on TikTok.</p><p>The trending hashtags change on a regular basis and tend to be region-specific.</p><p>Making videos about frogs or bears might not be your thing, especially when you do not have access to either animal.

Several Tiktokers create videos of them doing something that they are good at. This can be playing an instrument, skateboarding, or playing a sport like fire-eating or juggling. There are many dancers that showcase their skills in lip-sync videos.

First, you need an idea for making the first part of the video, where you are engaged in some type of activity, or the video involves some kind of interaction with others.

There are plenty of scenes that you can create, but you have to choose wisely. You can search on the internet, and you will find plenty of websites from where you can download these anime videos. The best exercise for selecting the video clip is, keep watching videos and if you find something interesting, download that clip.</p><h4 id="Step2-Shoot-Your-Own-Clip"><a href="#Step2-Shoot-Your-Own-Clip" class="headerlink" title="Step2: Shoot Your Own Clip"></a>Step2: Shoot Your Own Clip</h4><p>Once you have selected a clip from the anime series, you have to make your own video that matches the scene you selected from the anime video.

In TikTok videos, you may have seen two characters with a girl saying “Anime is trash” and a boy punching her, and then abruptly, the scene changes to Jujutsu Kaisen fight scene.</p><p>The punching scene is just an example, but you can come up with your own creative scenes that you can connect with anime clips and make interesting videos. Make sure to keep some points in your mind when shooting video,</p><ul><li>Keep the camera stable and make sure there are no shakes in your video. You can use a tripod for this purpose or fix your camera somewhere to keep it stable.

It is a Japanese manga series that got a lot of fame recently. A massive fan of anime might recognize the anime series for its intriguing fight sequences. Recently we have seen a huge trend of Jujutsu Kaisen videos on TikTok where she says “Anime is Trash,” and suddenly the scene turns into an anime fight scene. Technically, this is the filming term “jump cut.” You would likely want to create your own of these videos after watching them.</p><p>If you are one of the Jujutsu Kaisen fans and looking to create your TikTok montage, then you just landed on the right page. You can easily make such videos by using a video editor like Filmora X. In this article, we will walk through the steps involved in creating Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok montage videos. Now you can create your own scenes and connect them with Jutusu Kaisen fight scenes. Trust me, this is so much fun while editing it.</p><h2 id="Step-By-Step-Guide-For-Creating-Jujutsu-Kaisen-TikTok-Videos-1"><a href="#Step-By-Step-Guide-For-Creating-Jujutsu-Kaisen-TikTok-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Step By Step Guide For Creating Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok Videos"></a><strong>Step By Step Guide For Creating Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok Videos</strong></h2><p>It requires two things to produce such videos. First, you need an idea for making the first part of the video, where you are engaged in some type of activity, or the video involves some kind of interaction with others. Second, you need a clip from the anime that goes along with the first part of the video and justifies the action you perform in the first part of the video. You can create these videos in three simple steps.</p><hr><hr><h4 id="Step1-Download-The-Anime-Clip-From-the-Internet-1"><a href="#Step1-Download-The-Anime-Clip-From-the-Internet-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1: Download The Anime Clip From the Internet"></a>Step1: Download The Anime Clip From the Internet</h4><p>The first thing you need is the anime footage that you want to use in your video. There are plenty of scenes that you can create, but you have to choose wisely. You can search on the internet, and you will find plenty of websites from where you can download these anime videos. The best exercise for selecting the video clip is, keep watching videos and if you find something interesting, download that clip.</p><h4 id="Step2-Shoot-Your-Own-Clip-1"><a href="#Step2-Shoot-Your-Own-Clip-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2: Shoot Your Own Clip"></a>Step2: Shoot Your Own Clip</h4><p>Once you have selected a clip from the anime series, you have to make your own video that matches the scene you selected from the anime video. If there are two characters in anime, then you may also need two characters to make your own video. In TikTok videos, you may have seen two characters with a girl saying “Anime is trash” and a boy punching her, and then abruptly, the scene changes to Jujutsu Kaisen fight scene.</p><p>The punching scene is just an example, but you can come up with your own creative scenes that you can connect with anime clips and make interesting videos. Make sure to keep some points in your mind when shooting video,</p><ul><li>Keep the camera stable and make sure there are no shakes in your video. You can use a tripod for this purpose or fix your camera somewhere to keep it stable. Avoid recording video by holding the camera in your hand.</li><li>The video angle should be correct, and it should be according to the anime footage. For example, if the punching person is on the right side of anime footage, you should follow the same sequence.</li><li>It is recommended that the video be shot in sufficient natural light, but artificial lights may also be used.</li><li>It is crucial to use a high-quality camera when making videos. You can do this with a smartphone or camera, and you should make sure you are filming in 1080p. Low-quality video will not perform well.</li></ul><h4 id="Step3-Edit-and-Connect-both-Clips-1"><a href="#Step3-Edit-and-Connect-both-Clips-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3: Edit and Connect both Clips"></a>Step3: Edit and Connect both Clips</h4><p>Once you have both video clips, the next step is editing the video and joining them to create a fantastic scene. For this purpose, we will use the Filmora X video editing software, which is both easy to use and one of the best video editing programs. To edit your videos, follow the steps given below:</p><ol><li>Download Filmora X video editor from their official website, install it on your computer if it is already installed, and then run the program to start video editing.</li><li>Go to file, and click on import media and then click on import media files.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu1.png"                      alt="jujutsu1"                ></li><li>Now select both clips and import them to Filmora X.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu2.png"                      alt="jujutsu2"                ></li><li>Drag and drop your own video and bring it to the first track. Then drag and drop the anime video and place it next to your video in the track.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu3.png"                      alt="jujutsu3"                ></li><li>You may need to make some adjustments to both video clips so that the scenes perfectly match each other. The most important step in creating videos matches the sound where a person says, “Anime is trash,” and then the action happens.</li><li>Play the video to make sure everything is in position. If you feel that it still requires adjusting, then go back to the previous step and make the needed adjustments.</li><li>Music is critical to match to make the video looks smooth. Find your music to make them fit perfectly. For example, matching the hard beat with the punch or turning up the volume when the anime shows would be good ideas.</li><li>Once everything is perfectly aligned, your video is ready, and now you need to export it.</li><li>Click on the export button and select the desired video format from the list, i.e. (MP4, Gif, WMV, FLV, etc.).<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu4.png"                      alt="jujutsu4"                ></li><li>Once you have selected the desired format, click on export, and the video will take some time to render. Once rendered, you can now share the video with your friends and wow them. <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu5.gif"                      alt="jujutsu5"                ></li></ol><p>Conclusion: These are some simple steps using which you can create your own Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok Montage. Now it’s up to you to create new ideas and make interesting videos. We recommend using the Filmora X video editor because it is easy to use and can do wonders for you. Even if you don’t have any prior experience in video editing, you can follow these steps and create amazing videos.

For iPhone users, Siri is not new. Siri helps them read text messages and much more, but soon after the text-to-speech feature was added in TikTok, it took the TikTokers world by storm. But since the voice sounded so much like Siri, people started calling it Siri voice rather than text-to-speech. This feature allows users to convert any text into a speech using an automated voice. And if you have never used the text-to-speech feature, this post will help you understand <strong>how to do the Siri voice on TikTok.</strong></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Siri Voice?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">TikTok Voice Changer Apps</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Siri Voice?"></a>Part 1: What is Siri Voice?</h2><p>Siri voice in TikTok is basically an automated voice feature where the voice reads out the text on the video. The feature is called text-to-speech. So, whenever you enable it on your video, the text will be read out loud, which makes the video watching experience fun. Therefore, those who want to add a voice to their TikTok videos can use the text-to-speech feature and let the automated voice do that talking.</p><p>You will find almost everyone using it, even those who often use their voice in TikTok videos, and that’s because many TikTok users find it entertaining and funny. Well, no matter why you want to use this feature, find out <strong>how to do Siri voice on TikTok</strong> without any hassle in the next part!</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?"></a>Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</h2><p>To do Siri voice on TikTok, you will have to follow just a few simple steps. Here are the steps that you need to take care of:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch TikTok on your mobile phone.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start recording a video; else, upload an already recorded video.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the Upload button and then click on the checkmark.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, begin writing something on the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap on the text you have just written, and you will see the Text-to-Speech option.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Click on that and hear the automated voice reading your text.

Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps</h2><p>If you are not impressed with the Siri voice on TikTok and would instead like to use some other fun and peppy voice for the text, the good news is there are tons of apps that can help you do that. But before we share the names of the apps, let’s throw some light on why people are looking for such apps. First, if you are using TikTok’s text-to-speech feature in North America, you will hear a computer-automated female voice who will read out the text of the video.</p><p>But, when it comes to the UK, the app uses a computer-generated male voice with a rockin’ accent instead of a female voice. However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.</p><p>If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.</p><h3 id="1-Voice-Changer"><a href="#1-Voice-Changer" class="headerlink" title="1.

There are plenty of scenes that you can create, but you have to choose wisely. You can search on the internet, and you will find plenty of websites from where you can download these anime videos. The best exercise for selecting the video clip is, keep watching videos and if you find something interesting, download that clip.</p><h4 id="Step2-Shoot-Your-Own-Clip"><a href="#Step2-Shoot-Your-Own-Clip" class="headerlink" title="Step2: Shoot Your Own Clip"></a>Step2: Shoot Your Own Clip</h4><p>Once you have selected a clip from the anime series, you have to make your own video that matches the scene you selected from the anime video. If there are two characters in anime, then you may also need two characters to make your own video. In TikTok videos, you may have seen two characters with a girl saying “Anime is trash” and a boy punching her, and then abruptly, the scene changes to Jujutsu Kaisen fight scene.</p><p>The punching scene is just an example, but you can come up with your own creative scenes that you can connect with anime clips and make interesting videos. Make sure to keep some points in your mind when shooting video,</p><ul><li>Keep the camera stable and make sure there are no shakes in your video. You can use a tripod for this purpose or fix your camera somewhere to keep it stable. Avoid recording video by holding the camera in your hand.</li><li>The video angle should be correct, and it should be according to the anime footage. For example, if the punching person is on the right side of anime footage, you should follow the same sequence.</li><li>It is recommended that the video be shot in sufficient natural light, but artificial lights may also be used.</li><li>It is crucial to use a high-quality camera when making videos. You can do this with a smartphone or camera, and you should make sure you are filming in 1080p. Low-quality video will not perform well.</li></ul><h4 id="Step3-Edit-and-Connect-both-Clips"><a href="#Step3-Edit-and-Connect-both-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Step3: Edit and Connect both Clips"></a>Step3: Edit and Connect both Clips</h4><p>Once you have both video clips, the next step is editing the video and joining them to create a fantastic scene.

If you feel that it still requires adjusting, then go back to the previous step and make the needed adjustments.</li><li>Music is critical to match to make the video looks smooth. Find your music to make them fit perfectly. For example, matching the hard beat with the punch or turning up the volume when the anime shows would be good ideas.</li><li>Once everything is perfectly aligned, your video is ready, and now you need to export it.</li><li>Click on the export button and select the desired video format from the list, i.e. (MP4, Gif, WMV, FLV, etc.).<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu4.png"                      alt="jujutsu4"                ></li><li>Once you have selected the desired format, click on export, and the video will take some time to render.

You can create these videos in three simple steps.</p><hr><hr><h4 id="Step1-Download-The-Anime-Clip-From-the-Internet-1"><a href="#Step1-Download-The-Anime-Clip-From-the-Internet-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1: Download The Anime Clip From the Internet"></a>Step1: Download The Anime Clip From the Internet</h4><p>The first thing you need is the anime footage that you want to use in your video. There are plenty of scenes that you can create, but you have to choose wisely. You can search on the internet, and you will find plenty of websites from where you can download these anime videos. The best exercise for selecting the video clip is, keep watching videos and if you find something interesting, download that clip.</p><h4 id="Step2-Shoot-Your-Own-Clip-1"><a href="#Step2-Shoot-Your-Own-Clip-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2: Shoot Your Own Clip"></a>Step2: Shoot Your Own Clip</h4><p>Once you have selected a clip from the anime series, you have to make your own video that matches the scene you selected from the anime video. If there are two characters in anime, then you may also need two characters to make your own video. In TikTok videos, you may have seen two characters with a girl saying “Anime is trash” and a boy punching her, and then abruptly, the scene changes to Jujutsu Kaisen fight scene.</p><p>The punching scene is just an example, but you can come up with your own creative scenes that you can connect with anime clips and make interesting videos. Make sure to keep some points in your mind when shooting video,</p><ul><li>Keep the camera stable and make sure there are no shakes in your video. You can use a tripod for this purpose or fix your camera somewhere to keep it stable. Avoid recording video by holding the camera in your hand.</li><li>The video angle should be correct, and it should be according to the anime footage. For example, if the punching person is on the right side of anime footage, you should follow the same sequence.</li><li>It is recommended that the video be shot in sufficient natural light, but artificial lights may also be used.</li><li>It is crucial to use a high-quality camera when making videos. You can do this with a smartphone or camera, and you should make sure you are filming in 1080p. Low-quality video will not perform well.</li></ul><h4 id="Step3-Edit-and-Connect-both-Clips-1"><a href="#Step3-Edit-and-Connect-both-Clips-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3: Edit and Connect both Clips"></a>Step3: Edit and Connect both Clips</h4><p>Once you have both video clips, the next step is editing the video and joining them to create a fantastic scene. For this purpose, we will use the Filmora X video editing software, which is both easy to use and one of the best video editing programs. To edit your videos, follow the steps given below:</p><ol><li>Download Filmora X video editor from their official website, install it on your computer if it is already installed, and then run the program to start video editing.</li><li>Go to file, and click on import media and then click on import media files.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu1.png"                      alt="jujutsu1"                ></li><li>Now select both clips and import them to Filmora X.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu2.png"                      alt="jujutsu2"                ></li><li>Drag and drop your own video and bring it to the first track. Then drag and drop the anime video and place it next to your video in the track.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu3.png"                      alt="jujutsu3"                ></li><li>You may need to make some adjustments to both video clips so that the scenes perfectly match each other. The most important step in creating videos matches the sound where a person says, “Anime is trash,” and then the action happens.</li><li>Play the video to make sure everything is in position. If you feel that it still requires adjusting, then go back to the previous step and make the needed adjustments.</li><li>Music is critical to match to make the video looks smooth. Find your music to make them fit perfectly. For example, matching the hard beat with the punch or turning up the volume when the anime shows would be good ideas.</li><li>Once everything is perfectly aligned, your video is ready, and now you need to export it.</li><li>Click on the export button and select the desired video format from the list, i.e. (MP4, Gif, WMV, FLV, etc.).<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu4.png"                      alt="jujutsu4"                ></li><li>Once you have selected the desired format, click on export, and the video will take some time to render. Once rendered, you can now share the video with your friends and wow them. <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu5.gif"                      alt="jujutsu5"                ></li></ol><p>Conclusion: These are some simple steps using which you can create your own Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok Montage. Now it’s up to you to create new ideas and make interesting videos. We recommend using the Filmora X video editor because it is easy to use and can do wonders for you. Even if you don’t have any prior experience in video editing, you can follow these steps and create amazing videos. It may take some time, but you will get better eventually.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-choreographed-vocal-harmony-on-tiktok-for-2024/"><u>[New] Choreographed Vocal Harmony on TikTok for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-immerse-in-tiktok-entertainment-with-ease-and-grace/"><u>[New] Immerse in TikTok Entertainment with Ease and Grace</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-5-factors-to-master-when-using-tiktok-web-mac/"><u>[New] In 2024, Top 5 Factors to Master When Using TikTok Web (Mac)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-the-ultimate-selection-for-captivating-youtube-content-starts/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The Ultimate Selection for Captivating YouTube Content Starts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-choreographing-the-finale-for-your-tiktok-story/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Choreographing the Finale for Your TikTok Story</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/30plus-tiktok-bio-ideas-to-attract-more-followers-for-2024/"><u>30+ TikTok Bio Ideas to Attract More Followers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/best-pokemons-for-pvp-matches-in-pokemon-go-for-nokia-g22-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Best Pokemons for PVP Matches in Pokemon Go For Nokia G22 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/come-ridurre-le-dimensioni-dei-tuoi-filmati-senza-perdere-chiarezza-su-whatsapp-utilizzando-il-programma-winxdvd/"><u>Come Ridurre Le Dimensioni Dei Tuoi Filmati Senza Perdere Chiarezza Su WhatsApp Utilizzando Il Programma WinXDVD</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/effizientes-kopieren-von-dvd-filmen-auf-den-computer-mit-windows-10-und-macos-eine-einfache-anleitung/"><u>Effizientes Kopieren Von DVD-Filmen Auf Den Computer Mit Windows 10 Und macOS: Eine Einfache Anleitung</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-a-lost-realme-11-pro-for-free-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Track a Lost Realme 11 Pro for Free? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlocking-custom-tunes-for-your-pixel-phone/"><u>In 2024, Unlocking Custom Tunes for Your Pixel Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/safe-sharing-starts-here-the-copyright-check-for-tiktok-videos/"><u>Safe Sharing Starts Here The Copyright Check for TikTok Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/secrets-to-joining-friends-tiktok-live-events/"><u>Secrets to Joining Friends' TikTok Live Events</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-cod-modern-warfare-3-app-crashes-resolved/"><u>Troubleshooting Cod: Modern Warfare 3 App Crashes Resolved!</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

But what’s this? Your video gets muted or taken down! What a bummer!</p><p>The reason?</p><p>Copyright infringement, or in simple words, using music without the permission of the singer!</p><p>This includes external sounds that are not a part of the TikTok library.</p><p>So, what should we do to avoid this, you ask?</p><p>To avoid this, you need to learn how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading.</p><p>And, in this article, we will tell you exactly why you need to follow TikTok copyright, and how to check it before posting a video.</p><h2 id="Why-Do-You-Need-to-Follow-Tiktok-Copyright"><a href="#Why-Do-You-Need-to-Follow-Tiktok-Copyright" class="headerlink" title="Why Do You Need to Follow Tiktok Copyright?"></a><strong>Why Do You Need to Follow Tiktok Copyright?</strong></h2><p>To avoid getting banned!</p><p>You see, TikTok has a vast library of sounds with proper legal authorization that is available for the users to use in their videos. However, sometimes people use their own music in the videos.</p><p>The external sound may or may not be copyrighted.</p><p>If it does not have any copyrights on it, all is good. But in case you accidentally use a copyrighted video, TikTok automatically detects it, and either mutes your video or takes it down entirely. If the copyright is detected while posting, the platform will prevent you from uploading it in the first place.</p><p>To be on the safe side, we recommend using sounds already present in the TikTok library.</p><p>But, what if you want to use an external sound? Is there a way to check TikTok video copyright before uploading?</p><p>Yes, there is!

Anyone can go viral and become TikTok famous by gaining more likes, lots of views, and video shares. TikTok’s algorithm can put your videos at the top of the “For You” scroll and turn you into a sensation overnight, thus skyrocketing your followers count in a matter of few days. But, did you know that TikTok removed almost 50 million videos in just 6 months because those videos violated its rules?</p><p>While this social media site can easily be your shot to fame, it can even take away your audience. Or worse, it can ban you from using the app if you do not follow its community guidelines and rules. And, if you’ve been on TikTok for a while now, chances are you’ve heard about users getting ‘shadowbanned’. It’s not unusual for users to unknowingly stop receiving likes, views, and traffic on their accounts due to <strong>TikTok shadowban</strong>.</p><p>Ever since the influx of social media, shadow banning, also known as ghost banning or stealth banning, has been around. It comes up when content has been blocked or partially blocked. Sadly, when your TikTok account is shadowbanned, it will negatively affect your reach and halt your growth. Influencers and businesses rely on social media to create a community. And when they lose a part of that community, they feel a loss of support.</p><p>Wondering what shadowbanning entails, how to determine if you’ve been shadowbanned, and <strong>how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok</strong>? Check out below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

Basically, it means your account has been banned. But, the shadow part of the term means that you won’t know about the ban.</p><p>Shadowban on TikTok is a restriction that prevents your videos from appearing on the <strong>For You</strong> page or on hashtag results. It is a situation where your visibility has been reduced or where you have been banned from the platform, without your knowledge.</p><p>The act of shadowbanning a TikTok account is an automatic process done by TikTok’s algorithm to protect other users against spam content, copyright issues, and adult content. When you get shadowbanned, you stop receiving likes, views, and traffic from the For You page. Often, shadowbans go unnoticed until another user who stumbled upon your video points it out.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban"><a href="#Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?"></a>Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?</h2><p>At the early stages of TikTok, shadowbans lasted for 24 hours. But, with the latest update in the TikTok algorithm, the length of TikTok shadowban is growing. Nowadays, a TikTok account is shadowbanned for approximately up to 2 weeks.</p><p>Within the first week, there will be a drop in your followers and so will the views. After a few days of the account shadowban being in place, you won’t be able to enter any tags or make new videos on TikTok unless they are public.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-shadowban.png"                      alt="tiktok shadowban"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?"></a>Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?</h2><p>The TikTok app doesn’t ever actually tell if you are shadowbanned. But, if you are then you can probably notice it. If you are shadowbanned, your videos will neither show up on the TikTok “For You” page nor will they appear when you search them via hashtag.</p><p>During a TikTok shadowban, your videos and content will not:</p><ul><li>be visible in the search results</li><li>be visible on the feed</li><li>receive new followers</li><li>receive likes from others</li><li>receive comments from others</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105877/7443" target="_top" id="2105877">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105877" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105877/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?"></a>Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok has not issued any explanation on its shadowbanning techniques. However, what makes complete sense is that TikTok shadowbans its users for creating videos that violate its community guidelines.</p><p>Any video with offensive content that can harm the sentiments of people or anything that can trigger other users can attract TikTok shadowban. The app might limit the visibility of your content for reasons such as your account acting as spam or you are posting inappropriate content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shadowbanned-on-tiktok.png"                      alt="shadowbanned on tiktok"                ></p><p><strong>Spam Behavior</strong></p><p>The primary reason why a user’s TikTok account can get shadowbanned is that they behave like a spammer. Usually, new people go on a spree of liking and following people in the hope that they will like and follow back. However, TikTok might recognize this behavior as spam and consider you as a robot.</p><p>If you like more than 100 posts daily, you might want to slow down. If you follow more than 50 TikTok accounts in a day, it is best to re-evaluate that strategy.</p><p><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong></p><p>Posting videos that go against the TikTok rules and community guidelines can get you shadowbanned or permanently banned.</p><p>The following content is considered inappropriate by TikTok:</p><ul><li>hate speech</li><li>fake news</li><li>violence</li><li>nudity</li><li>drugs</li><li>copyrighted music</li></ul><p>TikTok is committed to make its platform an inclusive and safe space. So, if you have experienced a drop in views or engagement, consider reassessing your recent content.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129042/19576" target="_top" id="2129042">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129042" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129042/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?"></a>Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?</h2><p>Wondering about how do you get unshadowbanned on TikTok? Here’s what you can do to remove your shadowban:</p><h4 id="Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok"><a href="#Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok"></a>Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok</h4><p>Firstly, delete your recent video. If it doesn’t work, uninstall and then reinstall the TikTok app. Sometimes, your app might just need an update to become functional once again.</p><h4 id="Switch-to-A-Pro-Account"><a href="#Switch-to-A-Pro-Account" class="headerlink" title="Switch to A Pro Account"></a>Switch to A Pro Account</h4><p>When doing a Google search on how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok, the most common tip you’ll find is to go into the Settings of your TikTok account and tap “Switch to a Pro Account”. The reason is that making the switch will allow you to see analytics for your posts and find out how people access your videos. By doing this, you can easily monitor how far your engagement has increased or dropped.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-pro-account.jpg"                      alt="tiktok pro account"                ></p><h4 id="Delete-Offensive-Content"><a href="#Delete-Offensive-Content" class="headerlink" title="Delete Offensive Content"></a>Delete Offensive Content</h4><p>You should delete content that goes against the rules and community guidelines laid down by TikTok. After deleting inappropriate content, you have to wait for at least two weeks to get the shadowban lifted. You can refresh your device once in a while to check if you have finally managed to lift the ban.</p><h4 id="Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime"><a href="#Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime" class="headerlink" title="Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime"></a>Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime</h4><p>Once you have deleted offensive content, clear the cache, close your app, ensure it is updated and then take a break from TikTok for a few days. Coming back after you have cleaned up your account and taken the needed break might get you unshadowbanned on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Post-Original-Innovative-Content"><a href="#Post-Original-Innovative-Content" class="headerlink" title="Post Original, Innovative Content"></a>Post Original, Innovative Content</h4><p>When you return to posting content, you need to make sure your TikTok account doesn’t get shadowbanned again. Your account has already been flagged for something and so you need to try even harder to behave. If you go back to posting the same kind of content that got you banned in the first place, you will be booted off the stage again.</p><p>Ensure you always post original content with innovative ideas. Brainstorm new ideas with your team and come up with something new and unique. This way, you can avoid copyright infringement laws on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Know-Your-Audience-More"><a href="#Know-Your-Audience-More" class="headerlink" title="Know Your Audience More"></a>Know Your Audience More</h4><p>These days, there are many kids and minor accounts on TikTok, and maintaining a healthy environment is a part of your responsibility. Keep your videos free from sexualized themes, nudity, pornographic material, and suggestive themes. Remember; posting such content can land you in serious trouble with TikTok shadowban.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Use-Excellent-Video-Editors-to-Make-Amazing-TikTok-Videos"><a href="#Part-6-Use-Excellent-Video-Editors-to-Make-Amazing-TikTok-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Use Excellent Video Editors to Make Amazing TikTok Videos"></a>Part 6: Use Excellent Video Editors to Make Amazing TikTok Videos</h2><p>With increasing competition among TikTok users, it is important to use a powerful video editing tool to make your TikTok videos stand out.

PCs like this are commonly described as having adopted the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-raptor-lake-mobile-chips-get-soldered-to-micro-atx-motherboards" >MoDT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Mobile on Desktop) hybrid design.<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/mini-pcs/minisforum-atomman-g7-pt-touted-as-worlds-first-amd-advantage-mini-pc-packs-an-amd-r9-7945hx-and-rx-7600m-xt" >Mini PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/all-in-one-pcs" >All-in-Ones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> were the first to make MoDT popular, but they also usually used mobile GPUs (or just integrated graphics). In contrast, Lenovo’s new Legion 7000K PC series, now<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://item.lenovo.com.cn/product/1037096.html" >available in China <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , come in sizable tower cases and are sold with powerful Nvidia<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/features/nvidia-ada-lovelace-and-geforce-rtx-40-series-everything-we-know" >GeForce RTX 40 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> series GPUs pre-installed.</p><p> With an MoDT platform, if you want to change your CPU you would have to buy a complete new mainboard &#x2F; CPU &#x2F; cooler bundle. Mobile CPUs aren’t socketed but are<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-soldering-irons" >soldered <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the board, so the average tech enthusiast isn’t going to be able to swap or upgrade the CPU. Thus it is very important to consider this spec very carefully before committing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KiWmBjf3WBxdHs7uNFYu2U-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Lenovo Legion 7000K gaming PCs"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Lenovo)</p><p> Looking more closely at the new Legion 7000K machines, we see that they come with a choice between two pretty strong Intel Raptor Lake Refresh mobile CPUs. The most powerful option is the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-unleashes-14th-gen-raptor-lake-refresh-hx-series-laptops-cpus-refreshed-chips-with-up-to-24-cores-58-ghz-boost-clock-and-192gb-ddr5-support" >Core i9-14900HX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , with 24C&#x2F;32C, clock speeds up to 5.8 GHz, and 36MB Smart Cache. This powerful chip can be quite thrifty with its 55W base power, but also has a max turbo power of a laptop-melting 157W. In<a class="link"   href="https://browser.geekbench.com/processor-benchmarks" >Geekbench <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> nT rankings, for example, the performance of this CPU sits snugly between the Core i9-13900 and the Ryzen 9 PRO 7945 desktop chips – so it isn’t a lightweight.</p><p> One other CPU option is available to buyers, and that is the Core i7-14650HX. This is a 16C&#x2F;24T part, with clock speeds up to 5.2 GHz, and 30MB Smart Cache. Again there is a standard TDP of 55W, with the chip attempting to suck up to 157W if the situation demands it and cooling is adequate.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> As with other MoDT platforms, we aren’t sure if the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-cpu-coolers,4181.html" >cooling system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is easy to change or upgrade, as the mounts won’t likely be the same as in a desktop PC. Lenovo seems to indicate its CPU cooler is good for up to 190W. If the CPU cooling fan is standard, we guess it could be changed or upgraded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KHmtZBvJU6LcChAReYSDBU-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Lenovo Legion 7000K gaming PCs"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Lenovo)</p><p> Another spec of the Legion 7000K gaming desktop that users will have to decide upon is what GPU to choose. The product page allows the choice of RTX 4060 &#x2F; Ti, RTX 4070 Ti &#x2F; Super. As with a traditional desktop PC, users can upgrade at any time later.</p><p> Lastly, the new Legion systems come with a standard 32GB DDR5-5600 dual-channel RAM and 1TB<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ssds,3891.html" >PCIe Gen4 storage <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Again, upgrades shouldn’t be a problem in the future with SODIMMs presumably used for RAM, and two M.2 slots and two SATA ports available for storage.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p> A wide range of I&#x2F;O is available from the motherboard including one USB 3.2 gen2 Type-C, a plethora of other USB Type A ports,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/audio" >audio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> I&#x2F;O, 2.5G Ethernet (Wi-Fi 6 is also onboard), and DP video. The desktop GPU also has a trio of DP ports and an HDMI 2.1a output. Front I&#x2F;O consists of twin USB 3.2 Gen1 Type-A ports and audio I&#x2F;O. The system also comes with Nahimic 5.1 sound and some<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-11-rgb-controls-native" >RGB lighting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Lenovo is selling these Legion 7000K systems in China starting from around $1,300 (i7, RTX 4060), all the way up to around $2,350 (i9, RTX 4070 Ti Super). If those direct currency exchange figure prices were actual U.S. prices, these MoDT pre-builts wouldn’t really be very interesting. Customers should expect a decent discount to accept the CPU upgrade (and other) limitations.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-drafting-dynamic-news-endings/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Drafting Dynamic News Endings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-leading-video-conference-software-picks/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Leading Video-Conference Software Picks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-peak-color-alignment-tool/"><u>[New] Peak Color Alignment Tool</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-pewdiepies-paycheck-profile-a-glimpse-into-his-earnings-for-2024/"><u>[New] PewDiePie’s Paycheck Profile – A Glimpse Into His Earnings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-unleash-your-potential-strategies-for-recreating-yourself-on-tiktok-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unleash Your Potential Strategies for Recreating Yourself on TikTok for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-pinpoint-the-perfect-tag-for-your-personalized-tiktok-stream/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved How to Pinpoint the Perfect Tag for Your Personalized TikTok Stream</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-easy-steps-to-dance-and-unwind-with-these-top-20-songs-country-edition/"><u>2024 Approved Easy Steps to Dance & Unwind with These Top 20 Songs (Country Edition)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/24-clever-tiktoks-the-comedy-goldmine-for-2024/"><u>24 Clever TikToks The Comedy Goldmine for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/creating-an-individualistic-tiktok-identifier-for-2024/"><u>Creating an Individualistic TikTok Identifier for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-deleted-contacts-from-vivo-s17t-by-fonelab-android-recover-contacts/"><u>How to recover deleted contacts from Vivo S17t.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-special.techidaily.com/kostenloze-videovervanger-tool-naar-mp4-vrij-voor-belangelingen/"><u>Kostenloze Videovervanger Tool Naar MP4 - Vrij Voor Belangelingen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/mastering-time-changes-a-detailed-walkthrough-for-your-amazon-kindle-paperwhite/"><u>Mastering Time Changes: A Detailed Walkthrough for Your Amazon Kindle Paperwhite</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/remove-frp-lock-on-xiaomi-redmi-a2plus-by-drfone-android-unlock-remove-google-frp/"><u>Remove FRP Lock on Xiaomi Redmi A2+</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/top-rated-ipad-pro-13-protective-covers-and-skins-2024-edition/"><u>Top-Rated iPad Pro 13 Protective Covers & Skins - 2024 Edition</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139116/17108" target="_top" id="2139116">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139116" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139116/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Post a Video At Least Once Every Day"></a>1. Post a Video At Least Once Every Day</h3><p>The platform expects its successful creators to post videos often. In case you wish to go viral, you need to create enough content for people to notice you. If you would like to create a low-profile, your profile might not appear often in the user’s feed.</p><p>The top accounts release videos several times every day. However, this level of production might be difficult for one person without compromising on the video’s quality. So, upload at least one video every day.</p><h3 id="2-Make-Sure-the-Videos-are-of-High-Quality"><a href="#2-Make-Sure-the-Videos-are-of-High-Quality" class="headerlink" title="2. Make Sure the Videos are of High-Quality"></a>2. Make Sure the Videos are of High-Quality</h3><p>The importance of this cannot be emphasized enough. TikTok is all about trending videos. Hence, you have to make sure that you are sharing footage of top-notch quality. Yes, you might have to upload videos daily, but that doesn’t mean you should sacrifice quality for quantity. For this, however, you don’t have to employ a professional camera operator. You can create videos using your smartphone and then edit them using good software. This ensures that you make videos that will go viral. You can use an external microphone if the sound is an essential component.</p><h3 id="3-Do-Not-Ignore-Sounds"><a href="#3-Do-Not-Ignore-Sounds" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Not Ignore Sounds"></a>3. Do Not Ignore Sounds</h3><p>One of the primary differences of TikTok has been the liberty that it gives you to use music in the videos that people are sharing. It is incredibly easy to add music to your 15-seconds video on this platform. TikTok has made arrangements with the top music companies to get permission to use the copyrighted music extracts.</p><p>You will be able to add music tracks to your videos without any hassle from the app itself.</p><h3 id="4-Use-Trending-Hashtags-to-Keep-Up-with-the-Trends"><a href="#4-Use-Trending-Hashtags-to-Keep-Up-with-the-Trends" class="headerlink" title="4.

Use Trending Hashtags to Keep Up with the Trends</h3><p>When you open the TikTok app and tap on the ‘Discover’ button present at the bottom, it is going to show the trending hashtags. It is better to emulate some posts which you see on the ‘Discover’ page if you want the videos to trend on TikTok.</p><p>The trending hashtags change on a regular basis and tend to be region-specific.</p><p>Making videos about frogs or bears might not be your thing, especially when you do not have access to either animal. So, you need to look for trending hashtags that will be more relevant to your audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130875/7443" target="_top" id="2130875">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130875" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130875/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Showcase-Your-Skills-in-the-Video"><a href="#5-Showcase-Your-Skills-in-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="5.

Several Tiktokers create videos of them doing something that they are good at. This can be playing an instrument, skateboarding, or playing a sport like fire-eating or juggling. There are many dancers that showcase their skills in lip-sync videos. Hence, you need to recognize your skill and use it to make your videos.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>To make your videos stand out from the rest, you should <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >download FilmoraX on your Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and use it to edit your videos.

Though, to rival other apps like Instagram and TikTok, Snapchat has recently added a “Sound” feature. With this newly-added option, users can add music to a Snapchat video pretty easily and make their snaps more interesting. In this post, I’m going to let you know how to add music to a Snapchat video without any hassle. Let’s get it started and level-up your Snapchat game!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Sound-Feature-in-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Sound-Feature-in-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Sound Feature in Snapchat?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Sound Feature in Snapchat?</h2><p>Before we learn how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s quickly get to know about the “Sounds” feature of the app. If you have been using Instagram or TikTok, then you might be familiar with their music feature.</p><p>Similarly, in 2020, Snapchat has also included a Sound feature that lets us add music to our snaps (photos or videos). For this, you can integrate Snapchat with a streaming service like Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, or Soundcloud. While it doesn’t include all sorts of tracks, you can find most of the popular songs so that you can easily add music to a Snapchat video and make it interesting.</p><p>Once the other person would view your snap, they can hear the music playing in the background. If they want to listen to it or know more about the song, then they can just tap on its sticker on your snap.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1557742/17382" target="_top" id="1557742">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1557742" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1557742/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video-on-iPhone-or-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video-on-iPhone-or-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add Music to a Snapchat Video on iPhone or Android?"></a>Part 2: How to Add Music to a Snapchat Video on iPhone or Android?</h2><p>One of the best things about Snapchat is that the overall interface of the app is pretty similar for both iOS and Android versions. Therefore, to learn how to add music on a Snapchat video, you need to follow the same process. As of now, you can find almost all the popular songs on Snapchat and can even record your own sounds.</p><p>To learn how to add music to your Snapchat video on your Android or iOS device, you can just follow this simple drill.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Visit the Snapchat Sound section on the app</strong></p><p>At first, just launch the Snapchat application on your device and tap on the camera icon from the home to start recording.</p><p>Using the rear or front camera of your device, you can now record any video on Snapchat. Once the video is recorded, you can tap on the music icon from the sidebar to add a song to a Snapchat video.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Search for any music to include in your Snaps</strong></p><p>As you would tap on the <strong>Music</strong> icon, you can view a list of various songs supported by Snapchat. If you want to look for anything specific, then just tap on the search icon and enter keywords to find a song of your choice.</p><p>Afterward, Snapchat will list the searched results, and you can tap on the play icon to first listen to the song. Just tap on the icon of the song and click on the “Next” button from the bottom to include it in the snap.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Trim and add the song to your Snapchat video</strong></p><p>Now, Snapchat will automatically display the snippet of the music at the bottom. You can use the left or the right slider option to trim the section of the music you want to add. Here, you also can tap on the play icon to listen to the track first.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Add music to your Snapchat video after recording</strong></p><p>That’s it! Once you have trimmed the music snippet, you can post it. You can tap on the shutter or the download icon first to save the video on your phone.</p><p>Now, you can preview the music via its sticker. You can just tap on the music sticker to change its appearance or drag it on the screen to place it anywhere you like. To change its size, you can just pinch-in or pinch-out the sticker.</p><p>In the end, just tap on the send icon to post your snap. You can add it to your story or sent it to any Snapchat contact. When they would open it, they can listen to the added song and even tap on the sticker to load it.</p><p>In this way, anyone can learn how to put music on a Snapchat video without any hassle.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082539/7443" target="_top" id="2082539">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082539" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082539/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-FAQs-on-Adding-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video"><a href="#Part-3-FAQs-on-Adding-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: FAQs on Adding Music to a Snapchat Video"></a>Part 3: FAQs on Adding Music to a Snapchat Video</h2><p>Now when you know how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s clear some common doubts related to it.</p><ul><li><strong>How to add your own music to a Snapchat video?</strong></li></ul><p>Apart from the available songs on Snapchat, the app also lets us add the sound of our choice. For this, just click on the music icon and tap the “Create Sound” button instead. This will let you record anything or create your own music on Snapchat.</p><ul><li><strong>Why are some songs not available on Snapchat?</strong></li></ul><p>The Sound feature of Snapchat only provides licensed music by collaborating with some of the biggest record labels. Therefore, while you can find most of the popular songs, chances are that some of them might be missing from the collection.</p><ul><li><strong>Why can’t I add music to my Snapchat videos?</strong></li></ul><p>Well, there could be two possible reasons for this – you might be using an old version of Snapchat or the feature might not be available in your region yet. To fix this, you can just go to the Snapchat page on the App&#x2F;Play Store and tap on the “Update” button. Furthermore, if the Sound feature has not been rolled out to your region, then you can just wait for a while.</p><p>As you can see, it is pretty easy to learn how to add music to a Snapchat video like a pro. With the newly-added Sounds feature, it is pretty easy to add a song to your Snapchat videos and make them more interesting.

Post a Video At Least Once Every Day"></a>1. Post a Video At Least Once Every Day</h3><p>The platform expects its successful creators to post videos often. In case you wish to go viral, you need to create enough content for people to notice you. If you would like to create a low-profile, your profile might not appear often in the user’s feed.</p><p>The top accounts release videos several times every day. However, this level of production might be difficult for one person without compromising on the video’s quality. So, upload at least one video every day.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886069/19272" target="_top" id="1886069">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886069" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886069/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Make-Sure-the-Videos-are-of-High-Quality"><a href="#2-Make-Sure-the-Videos-are-of-High-Quality" class="headerlink" title="2. Make Sure the Videos are of High-Quality"></a>2. Make Sure the Videos are of High-Quality</h3><p>The importance of this cannot be emphasized enough. TikTok is all about trending videos. Hence, you have to make sure that you are sharing footage of top-notch quality. Yes, you might have to upload videos daily, but that doesn’t mean you should sacrifice quality for quantity. For this, however, you don’t have to employ a professional camera operator. You can create videos using your smartphone and then edit them using good software. This ensures that you make videos that will go viral. You can use an external microphone if the sound is an essential component.</p><h3 id="3-Do-Not-Ignore-Sounds"><a href="#3-Do-Not-Ignore-Sounds" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Not Ignore Sounds"></a>3. Do Not Ignore Sounds</h3><p>One of the primary differences of TikTok has been the liberty that it gives you to use music in the videos that people are sharing. It is incredibly easy to add music to your 15-seconds video on this platform. TikTok has made arrangements with the top music companies to get permission to use the copyrighted music extracts.</p><p>You will be able to add music tracks to your videos without any hassle from the app itself.</p><h3 id="4-Use-Trending-Hashtags-to-Keep-Up-with-the-Trends"><a href="#4-Use-Trending-Hashtags-to-Keep-Up-with-the-Trends" class="headerlink" title="4. Use Trending Hashtags to Keep Up with the Trends"></a>4. Use Trending Hashtags to Keep Up with the Trends</h3><p>When you open the TikTok app and tap on the ‘Discover’ button present at the bottom, it is going to show the trending hashtags. It is better to emulate some posts which you see on the ‘Discover’ page if you want the videos to trend on TikTok.</p><p>The trending hashtags change on a regular basis and tend to be region-specific.</p><p>Making videos about frogs or bears might not be your thing, especially when you do not have access to either animal. So, you need to look for trending hashtags that will be more relevant to your audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137223/26400" target="_top" id="2137223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137223/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Showcase-Your-Skills-in-the-Video"><a href="#5-Showcase-Your-Skills-in-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="5. Showcase Your Skills in the Video"></a>5. Showcase Your Skills in the Video</h3><p>In case you are looking for content ideas for the videos, you should ask yourself the skill you have. Several Tiktokers create videos of them doing something that they are good at. This can be playing an instrument, skateboarding, or playing a sport like fire-eating or juggling. There are many dancers that showcase their skills in lip-sync videos. Hence, you need to recognize your skill and use it to make your videos.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>To make your videos stand out from the rest, you should <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >download FilmoraX on your Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and use it to edit your videos. The software comes with different effects and features that you can use to make your videos go viral.

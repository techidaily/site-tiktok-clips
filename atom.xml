The only thing is, most people have quite a few interests, and so your server is likely to be fighting for attention amongst many other servers. Users can join up to 100, after all. So, a good <strong>Discord server logo</strong> is essential, as it makes it easier for your server to stand out and be found. This article will look at the best free Discord server logo makers.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Best Free Discord Server Logo Maker</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Discord Logos and Icons - Free Download Sites</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Making A Logo for Your Discord Server Channel Tips</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs about Discord Logo and Icon</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Free-Discord-Server-Logo-Maker"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Free-Discord-Server-Logo-Maker" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Free Discord Server Logo Maker"></a>Part 1: Best Free Discord Server Logo Maker</h2><p>We’ve picked out some of the best free logo makers, so you can customize your own Discord server logo.</p><h3 id="1-Logo-Bot"><a href="#1-Logo-Bot" class="headerlink" title="1  Logo.Bot"></a>1  Logo.Bot</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.logo.bot/" >Logo.Bot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> uses AI to generate your logo for you, so that you don’t need to worry about drawing anything. It can create a professional logo that you can easily download to use for your Discord server.</p><p>Firstly, it’ll ask for your ‘Company’ information – just use the name and description of your Discord server.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fill-in-company-info-logo-bot.jpg"                      alt="Discord Logo Maker - Logo Bot"                ></p><p>You’ll then be asked to choose a colour scheme, so pick one that is either relevant to your server or that you simply like. You can pick up at most 3 colors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-color-logo-bot.jpg"                      alt="Discord Logo Maker - Logo Bot - select color"                ></p><p>Next, it’ll give you a list of icons to choose from based on your details already entered, but you can still search for new keywords if you want. Choose up to five icons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-icon-preference.jpg"                      alt=" Logo Bot icon Preference"                ></p><p>Logo Bot will then generate 3 logos based on the information provided before. You can then edit your favourite options using the site’s built-in tools.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-preview.jpg"                      alt=" Logo Bot preview"                ></p><p>Once you’re done, you can download a free version of your logo as a low-resolution JPG. The problem is that it’ll come with a watermark. If you want the version that is best suited to Discord without a watermark, you’ll need to pay a one-off fee of $20.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt=" Logo Bot editing interface"                ></p><h3 id="2-MyBrandNewLogo"><a href="#2-MyBrandNewLogo" class="headerlink" title="2  MyBrandNewLogo"></a>2  MyBrandNewLogo</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://mybrandnewlogo.com/" >MyBrandNewLogo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another option that makes it simple to create Discord logos. They even have a specialist tool just for Discord. You’ll start by giving the name of your server (‘Company’) again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MyBrandNewLogo-start-interface.jpg"                      alt=" MyBrandNewLogo interface"                ></p><p>Then, you can enter some keywords to help it choose the icons to use as part of your logo.</p><p>With MyBrandNewLogo, the colour options are slightly more limited than with Logo.Bot, but you can also ask it to surprise you if you aren’t too fussed about the colour to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MyBrandNewLogo-select-color.jpg"                      alt=" MyBrandNewLogo select color "                ></p><p>From there, you’ll again be shown a mix of icons and fonts combined to create a logo. You can then edit the layout of your logo, the background, add a slogan, change the icon and more to tailor it to your exact specifications.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mybrandnewlogo-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt=" MyBrandNewLogo editing "                ></p><p>Unfortunately again you do need to sign up and pay to download your logo. A basic package with one low-res file is €20, while the Professional pack costs €50.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mybrandnewlogo-perchase-interface.jpg"                      alt=" MyBrandNewLogo purchase interface "                ></p><h3 id="3-Logo-com"><a href="#3-Logo-com" class="headerlink" title="3  Logo.com"></a>3  Logo.com</h3><p>The third option is <a class="link"   href="https://logo.com/" >https://logo.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Here you dive straight in – as soon as you’ve entered your Discord server name. You will see a list of logos that you can use as a base design. So it automatically reads your server name and searches for icons related to the term. For the generated logo files, click the Custmoize button to adjust.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/auto-generated-logos.jpg"                      alt=" Logo.com interface "                ></p><p>You can then work your way down the list on the left, editing the icons to decide where you want it to live, and how big it should be. You can adjust its design, the icons on the logo, the color and the colour themes of your logo, the text, including the font and any changes to how it’s displayed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt=" Logo.com editing interface "                ></p><p>Once done, you can then preview your final logo. And yet again, you need to pay to download the full version. It’s $19.99 for a high-res PNG and JPG, but if you want a scalable Vector you need to pay $59.99 for the Starter Kit.</p><h3 id="4-BrandCrowd"><a href="#4-BrandCrowd" class="headerlink" title="4  BrandCrowd"></a>4  BrandCrowd</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.brandcrowd.com/" >BrandCrowd <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another logo creation site you could use, where again you simply enter your Discord server name and it’ll instantly generate icons for you to customize. Unlike Logo.com it doesn’t have a simple step-by-step editor, but instead it’s a lot more powerful, with various tools you can use to adjust shadows, layers and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/BrandCrowd-generated-logo-interface.jpg"                      alt=" BrandCrowd logo maker interface "                ></p><p>Once you’ve played with the editor, you can click Preview to see how it’ll look on a dummy website (or even on merch), then Download to sign up and access the files…but again they are hidden behind a paywall. BrandCrowd is one of the more expensive options too – a one off fee is $45 to get the high res PNG and JPG as well as vector files, or you can subscribe for $15 per month to unlock unlimited edits and downloads. The previews are watermarked to prevent you from just taking them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/BrandCrowd-generated-logo-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt=" BrandCrowd logo maker editing interface "                ></p><h3 id="5-Kapwing"><a href="#5-Kapwing" class="headerlink" title="5  Kapwing"></a>5  Kapwing</h3><p>The final recommendation is <a class="link"   href="https://www.kapwing.com/explore/discord-server-icon-maker-512x512-pixels" >Kapwing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Kapwing is, by far, the most comprehensive tool we’ve suggested so far. It isn’t just for creating logos, but working on all kinds of exportable content. The link we’ve included will take you straight to a dedicated workspace for Discord logos, but you’ll then need to upload all of your own imagery (although you can search Kapwing’s own resource collection) and make changes. It requires more skill, but the end results are more professional.</p><p>Using the menu at the top, you can play with text, add extra elements, or use the image tool to upload your own files or search Kapwing’s database.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-logo-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt=" Kapwing logo maker editing interface "                ></p><p>Once you’ve edited your logo, it’s already pre-set to download at 512 x 512. You’ll just need to create an account to access your download without a watermark, but it is free. The only drawback is that files are only available as JPG or GIF – so you can’t use a PNG with a transparent background.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of the ‘free’ online tools for creating Discord server logos aren’t actually free, or they come with limitations. There are other options than using online tools to create a logo however.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Discord-Logos-and-Icons-Free-Download-Sites"><a href="#Part-2-Discord-Logos-and-Icons-Free-Download-Sites" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Discord Logos and Icons - Free Download Sites"></a>Part 2: Discord Logos and Icons - Free Download Sites</h2><p>Rather than creating your own logo, you might want a helping hand – these download sites let you choose an existing icon, and edit it to your own tastes.</p><h3 id="1-Icons8"><a href="#1-Icons8" class="headerlink" title="1  Icons8"></a>1  Icons8</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://icons8.com/" >Icons8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is by far the best option of all the free icon download sites. It’s really easy to use, with clear categorization to make finding the perfect logo easier. You can download each icon in PNG or SVG format (or even PDF, if you wanted to for some reason) and customize the size. You can embed the HTML directly and, if you download the Lunacy editor, make tweaks to it before you download it. It’s super simple, and the only minor drawback is you’ll need to register an account, but it’s free.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons8-discord-icons-download.jpg"                      alt=" Icons8 Discord logo Download "                ></p><h3 id="2-Iconfinder"><a href="#2-Iconfinder" class="headerlink" title="2  Iconfinder"></a>2  Iconfinder</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.iconfinder.com/" >Iconfinder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is also relatively easy to navigate, and it also lets you download a PNG or SVG version of the file in a size that you prefer. You can’t edit, nor can you embed the HTML, and many of the icons are behind a paywall. However when you do find a free one, you can download it without a subscription.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iconfinder-discord-icon.jpg"                      alt=" Iconfinder  Discord logo Download "                ></p><h3 id="3-BrandEPS"><a href="#3-BrandEPS" class="headerlink" title="3  BrandEPS"></a>3  BrandEPS</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.brandeps.com/" >BrandEPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another popular name for icon downloading but it specializes in existing brand logos. If you want something distinct and unique, you won’t find it here. But if your Discord server is about an existing brand, you can probably download its logo here in either a vector EPS or as part of a zip file with SVG, PNG and JPG versions. No need to sign up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/brandeps-discord-logo-vector.jpg"                      alt=" BrandEPS Discord logo Download "                ></p><h3 id="4-FreePNGLogos"><a href="#4-FreePNGLogos" class="headerlink" title="4  FreePNGLogos"></a>4  FreePNGLogos</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.freepnglogos.com/" >FreePNGLogos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another database of existing company icons and logos, and as you can probably guess from the name, they’re available to download as PNG files. The sizes are limited to the size it’s been uploaded as, and there’s no easy way to browse, you’ll need to search using key terms and hope you find something suitable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/freepnglogos-discord-logo-png.jpg"                      alt=" FreePNGLogos Discord logo Download "                ></p><h3 id="5-SeekLogo"><a href="#5-SeekLogo" class="headerlink" title="5  SeekLogo"></a>5  SeekLogo</h3><p>Finally, <a class="link"   href="https://seeklogo.com/" >SeekLogo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has a large database of corporate logos but they’re not optimized icons, they’re full size logos including full business names. Downloads are mainly in SVG format, and again the option to browse is minimal, you’ll be relying on search terms and the categorization of icons isn’t the most intuitive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/seeklogo-discord.jpg"                      alt=" SeekLogo Discord logo Download "                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Making-A-Logo-for-Your-Discord-Server-Channel-Tips"><a href="#Part-3-Making-A-Logo-for-Your-Discord-Server-Channel-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Making A Logo for Your Discord Server Channel - Tips"></a>Part 3: Making A Logo for Your Discord Server Channel - Tips</h2><p>When you’re naming your server, a longer name might be harder to remember. If you can create a name that you can then abbreviate, you can include the abbreviation in your logo design, so it’s even easier to find your server. Even better, if it can be an acronym (an abbreviation that also forms its own short word) then it’ll be even more memorable.</p><p>The other key tip when creating your Discord server logo is to embrace your creativity! Don’t be scared to really make your logo stand out, especially when it’s around a topic that other Discord servers may exist for. You need to make it easy for your server logo to be understood and remembered, and a bold logo is ideal.</p><h2 id="FAQs"><a href="#FAQs" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><h4 id="1-What-is-a-Discord-Logo"><a href="#1-What-is-a-Discord-Logo" class="headerlink" title="1.

This article will look at the best free Discord server logo makers.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Best Free Discord Server Logo Maker</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Discord Logos and Icons - Free Download Sites</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Making A Logo for Your Discord Server Channel Tips</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs about Discord Logo and Icon</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Free-Discord-Server-Logo-Maker-1"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Free-Discord-Server-Logo-Maker-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Free Discord Server Logo Maker"></a>Part 1: Best Free Discord Server Logo Maker</h2><p>We’ve picked out some of the best free logo makers, so you can customize your own Discord server logo.</p><h3 id="1-Logo-Bot-1"><a href="#1-Logo-Bot-1" class="headerlink" title="1  Logo.Bot"></a>1  Logo.Bot</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.logo.bot/" >Logo.Bot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> uses AI to generate your logo for you, so that you don’t need to worry about drawing anything. It can create a professional logo that you can easily download to use for your Discord server.</p><p>Firstly, it’ll ask for your ‘Company’ information – just use the name and description of your Discord server.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fill-in-company-info-logo-bot.jpg"                      alt="Discord Logo Maker - Logo Bot"                ></p><p>You’ll then be asked to choose a colour scheme, so pick one that is either relevant to your server or that you simply like. You can pick up at most 3 colors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-color-logo-bot.jpg"                      alt="Discord Logo Maker - Logo Bot - select color"                ></p><p>Next, it’ll give you a list of icons to choose from based on your details already entered, but you can still search for new keywords if you want. Choose up to five icons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-icon-preference.jpg"                      alt=" Logo Bot icon Preference"                ></p><p>Logo Bot will then generate 3 logos based on the information provided before. You can then edit your favourite options using the site’s built-in tools.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-preview.jpg"                      alt=" Logo Bot preview"                ></p><p>Once you’re done, you can download a free version of your logo as a low-resolution JPG. The problem is that it’ll come with a watermark. If you want the version that is best suited to Discord without a watermark, you’ll need to pay a one-off fee of $20.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt=" Logo Bot editing interface"                ></p><h3 id="2-MyBrandNewLogo-1"><a href="#2-MyBrandNewLogo-1" class="headerlink" title="2  MyBrandNewLogo"></a>2  MyBrandNewLogo</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://mybrandnewlogo.com/" >MyBrandNewLogo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another option that makes it simple to create Discord logos. They even have a specialist tool just for Discord. You’ll start by giving the name of your server (‘Company’) again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MyBrandNewLogo-start-interface.jpg"                      alt=" MyBrandNewLogo interface"                ></p><p>Then, you can enter some keywords to help it choose the icons to use as part of your logo.</p><p>With MyBrandNewLogo, the colour options are slightly more limited than with Logo.Bot, but you can also ask it to surprise you if you aren’t too fussed about the colour to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MyBrandNewLogo-select-color.jpg"                      alt=" MyBrandNewLogo select color "                ></p><p>From there, you’ll again be shown a mix of icons and fonts combined to create a logo. You can then edit the layout of your logo, the background, add a slogan, change the icon and more to tailor it to your exact specifications.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mybrandnewlogo-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt=" MyBrandNewLogo editing "                ></p><p>Unfortunately again you do need to sign up and pay to download your logo. A basic package with one low-res file is €20, while the Professional pack costs €50.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mybrandnewlogo-perchase-interface.jpg"                      alt=" MyBrandNewLogo purchase interface "                ></p><h3 id="3-Logo-com-1"><a href="#3-Logo-com-1" class="headerlink" title="3  Logo.com"></a>3  Logo.com</h3><p>The third option is <a class="link"   href="https://logo.com/" >https://logo.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Here you dive straight in – as soon as you’ve entered your Discord server name. You will see a list of logos that you can use as a base design. So it automatically reads your server name and searches for icons related to the term. For the generated logo files, click the Custmoize button to adjust.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/auto-generated-logos.jpg"                      alt=" Logo.com interface "                ></p><p>You can then work your way down the list on the left, editing the icons to decide where you want it to live, and how big it should be. You can adjust its design, the icons on the logo, the color and the colour themes of your logo, the text, including the font and any changes to how it’s displayed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt=" Logo.com editing interface "                ></p><p>Once done, you can then preview your final logo. And yet again, you need to pay to download the full version. It’s $19.99 for a high-res PNG and JPG, but if you want a scalable Vector you need to pay $59.99 for the Starter Kit.</p><h3 id="4-BrandCrowd-1"><a href="#4-BrandCrowd-1" class="headerlink" title="4  BrandCrowd"></a>4  BrandCrowd</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.brandcrowd.com/" >BrandCrowd <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another logo creation site you could use, where again you simply enter your Discord server name and it’ll instantly generate icons for you to customize. Unlike Logo.com it doesn’t have a simple step-by-step editor, but instead it’s a lot more powerful, with various tools you can use to adjust shadows, layers and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/BrandCrowd-generated-logo-interface.jpg"                      alt=" BrandCrowd logo maker interface "                ></p><p>Once you’ve played with the editor, you can click Preview to see how it’ll look on a dummy website (or even on merch), then Download to sign up and access the files…but again they are hidden behind a paywall. BrandCrowd is one of the more expensive options too – a one off fee is $45 to get the high res PNG and JPG as well as vector files, or you can subscribe for $15 per month to unlock unlimited edits and downloads. The previews are watermarked to prevent you from just taking them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/BrandCrowd-generated-logo-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt=" BrandCrowd logo maker editing interface "                ></p><h3 id="5-Kapwing-1"><a href="#5-Kapwing-1" class="headerlink" title="5  Kapwing"></a>5  Kapwing</h3><p>The final recommendation is <a class="link"   href="https://www.kapwing.com/explore/discord-server-icon-maker-512x512-pixels" >Kapwing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Kapwing is, by far, the most comprehensive tool we’ve suggested so far. It isn’t just for creating logos, but working on all kinds of exportable content. The link we’ve included will take you straight to a dedicated workspace for Discord logos, but you’ll then need to upload all of your own imagery (although you can search Kapwing’s own resource collection) and make changes. It requires more skill, but the end results are more professional.</p><p>Using the menu at the top, you can play with text, add extra elements, or use the image tool to upload your own files or search Kapwing’s database.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-logo-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt=" Kapwing logo maker editing interface "                ></p><p>Once you’ve edited your logo, it’s already pre-set to download at 512 x 512. You’ll just need to create an account to access your download without a watermark, but it is free. The only drawback is that files are only available as JPG or GIF – so you can’t use a PNG with a transparent background.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of the ‘free’ online tools for creating Discord server logos aren’t actually free, or they come with limitations. There are other options than using online tools to create a logo however.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Discord-Logos-and-Icons-Free-Download-Sites-1"><a href="#Part-2-Discord-Logos-and-Icons-Free-Download-Sites-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Discord Logos and Icons - Free Download Sites"></a>Part 2: Discord Logos and Icons - Free Download Sites</h2><p>Rather than creating your own logo, you might want a helping hand – these download sites let you choose an existing icon, and edit it to your own tastes.</p><h3 id="1-Icons8-1"><a href="#1-Icons8-1" class="headerlink" title="1  Icons8"></a>1  Icons8</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://icons8.com/" >Icons8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is by far the best option of all the free icon download sites. It’s really easy to use, with clear categorization to make finding the perfect logo easier. You can download each icon in PNG or SVG format (or even PDF, if you wanted to for some reason) and customize the size. You can embed the HTML directly and, if you download the Lunacy editor, make tweaks to it before you download it. It’s super simple, and the only minor drawback is you’ll need to register an account, but it’s free.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons8-discord-icons-download.jpg"                      alt=" Icons8 Discord logo Download "                ></p><h3 id="2-Iconfinder-1"><a href="#2-Iconfinder-1" class="headerlink" title="2  Iconfinder"></a>2  Iconfinder</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.iconfinder.com/" >Iconfinder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is also relatively easy to navigate, and it also lets you download a PNG or SVG version of the file in a size that you prefer. You can’t edit, nor can you embed the HTML, and many of the icons are behind a paywall. However when you do find a free one, you can download it without a subscription.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iconfinder-discord-icon.jpg"                      alt=" Iconfinder  Discord logo Download "                ></p><h3 id="3-BrandEPS-1"><a href="#3-BrandEPS-1" class="headerlink" title="3  BrandEPS"></a>3  BrandEPS</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.brandeps.com/" >BrandEPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another popular name for icon downloading but it specializes in existing brand logos. If you want something distinct and unique, you won’t find it here. But if your Discord server is about an existing brand, you can probably download its logo here in either a vector EPS or as part of a zip file with SVG, PNG and JPG versions. No need to sign up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/brandeps-discord-logo-vector.jpg"                      alt=" BrandEPS Discord logo Download "                ></p><h3 id="4-FreePNGLogos-1"><a href="#4-FreePNGLogos-1" class="headerlink" title="4  FreePNGLogos"></a>4  FreePNGLogos</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.freepnglogos.com/" >FreePNGLogos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another database of existing company icons and logos, and as you can probably guess from the name, they’re available to download as PNG files. The sizes are limited to the size it’s been uploaded as, and there’s no easy way to browse, you’ll need to search using key terms and hope you find something suitable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/freepnglogos-discord-logo-png.jpg"                      alt=" FreePNGLogos Discord logo Download "                ></p><h3 id="5-SeekLogo-1"><a href="#5-SeekLogo-1" class="headerlink" title="5  SeekLogo"></a>5  SeekLogo</h3><p>Finally, <a class="link"   href="https://seeklogo.com/" >SeekLogo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has a large database of corporate logos but they’re not optimized icons, they’re full size logos including full business names. Downloads are mainly in SVG format, and again the option to browse is minimal, you’ll be relying on search terms and the categorization of icons isn’t the most intuitive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/seeklogo-discord.jpg"                      alt=" SeekLogo Discord logo Download "                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Making-A-Logo-for-Your-Discord-Server-Channel-Tips-1"><a href="#Part-3-Making-A-Logo-for-Your-Discord-Server-Channel-Tips-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Making A Logo for Your Discord Server Channel - Tips"></a>Part 3: Making A Logo for Your Discord Server Channel - Tips</h2><p>When you’re naming your server, a longer name might be harder to remember. If you can create a name that you can then abbreviate, you can include the abbreviation in your logo design, so it’s even easier to find your server. Even better, if it can be an acronym (an abbreviation that also forms its own short word) then it’ll be even more memorable.</p><p>The other key tip when creating your Discord server logo is to embrace your creativity! Don’t be scared to really make your logo stand out, especially when it’s around a topic that other Discord servers may exist for. You need to make it easy for your server logo to be understood and remembered, and a bold logo is ideal.</p><h2 id="FAQs-1"><a href="#FAQs-1" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><h4 id="1-What-is-a-Discord-Logo-1"><a href="#1-What-is-a-Discord-Logo-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Choose up to five icons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-icon-preference.jpg"                      alt=" Logo Bot icon Preference"                ></p><p>Logo Bot will then generate 3 logos based on the information provided before. You can then edit your favourite options using the site’s built-in tools.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-preview.jpg"                      alt=" Logo Bot preview"                ></p><p>Once you’re done, you can download a free version of your logo as a low-resolution JPG. The problem is that it’ll come with a watermark. If you want the version that is best suited to Discord without a watermark, you’ll need to pay a one-off fee of $20.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-bot-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt=" Logo Bot editing interface"                ></p><h3 id="2-MyBrandNewLogo-2"><a href="#2-MyBrandNewLogo-2" class="headerlink" title="2  MyBrandNewLogo"></a>2  MyBrandNewLogo</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://mybrandnewlogo.com/" >MyBrandNewLogo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another option that makes it simple to create Discord logos. They even have a specialist tool just for Discord. You’ll start by giving the name of your server (‘Company’) again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MyBrandNewLogo-start-interface.jpg"                      alt=" MyBrandNewLogo interface"                ></p><p>Then, you can enter some keywords to help it choose the icons to use as part of your logo.</p><p>With MyBrandNewLogo, the colour options are slightly more limited than with Logo.Bot, but you can also ask it to surprise you if you aren’t too fussed about the colour to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MyBrandNewLogo-select-color.jpg"                      alt=" MyBrandNewLogo select color "                ></p><p>From there, you’ll again be shown a mix of icons and fonts combined to create a logo. You can then edit the layout of your logo, the background, add a slogan, change the icon and more to tailor it to your exact specifications.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mybrandnewlogo-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt=" MyBrandNewLogo editing "                ></p><p>Unfortunately again you do need to sign up and pay to download your logo. A basic package with one low-res file is €20, while the Professional pack costs €50.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mybrandnewlogo-perchase-interface.jpg"                      alt=" MyBrandNewLogo purchase interface "                ></p><h3 id="3-Logo-com-2"><a href="#3-Logo-com-2" class="headerlink" title="3  Logo.com"></a>3  Logo.com</h3><p>The third option is <a class="link"   href="https://logo.com/" >https://logo.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Here you dive straight in – as soon as you’ve entered your Discord server name. You will see a list of logos that you can use as a base design. So it automatically reads your server name and searches for icons related to the term. For the generated logo files, click the Custmoize button to adjust.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/auto-generated-logos.jpg"                      alt=" Logo.com interface "                ></p><p>You can then work your way down the list on the left, editing the icons to decide where you want it to live, and how big it should be. You can adjust its design, the icons on the logo, the color and the colour themes of your logo, the text, including the font and any changes to how it’s displayed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt=" Logo.com editing interface "                ></p><p>Once done, you can then preview your final logo. And yet again, you need to pay to download the full version. It’s $19.99 for a high-res PNG and JPG, but if you want a scalable Vector you need to pay $59.99 for the Starter Kit.</p><h3 id="4-BrandCrowd-2"><a href="#4-BrandCrowd-2" class="headerlink" title="4  BrandCrowd"></a>4  BrandCrowd</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.brandcrowd.com/" >BrandCrowd <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another logo creation site you could use, where again you simply enter your Discord server name and it’ll instantly generate icons for you to customize. Unlike Logo.com it doesn’t have a simple step-by-step editor, but instead it’s a lot more powerful, with various tools you can use to adjust shadows, layers and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/BrandCrowd-generated-logo-interface.jpg"                      alt=" BrandCrowd logo maker interface "                ></p><p>Once you’ve played with the editor, you can click Preview to see how it’ll look on a dummy website (or even on merch), then Download to sign up and access the files…but again they are hidden behind a paywall. BrandCrowd is one of the more expensive options too – a one off fee is $45 to get the high res PNG and JPG as well as vector files, or you can subscribe for $15 per month to unlock unlimited edits and downloads. The previews are watermarked to prevent you from just taking them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/BrandCrowd-generated-logo-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt=" BrandCrowd logo maker editing interface "                ></p><h3 id="5-Kapwing-2"><a href="#5-Kapwing-2" class="headerlink" title="5  Kapwing"></a>5  Kapwing</h3><p>The final recommendation is <a class="link"   href="https://www.kapwing.com/explore/discord-server-icon-maker-512x512-pixels" >Kapwing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Kapwing is, by far, the most comprehensive tool we’ve suggested so far. It isn’t just for creating logos, but working on all kinds of exportable content. The link we’ve included will take you straight to a dedicated workspace for Discord logos, but you’ll then need to upload all of your own imagery (although you can search Kapwing’s own resource collection) and make changes. It requires more skill, but the end results are more professional.</p><p>Using the menu at the top, you can play with text, add extra elements, or use the image tool to upload your own files or search Kapwing’s database.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-logo-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt=" Kapwing logo maker editing interface "                ></p><p>Once you’ve edited your logo, it’s already pre-set to download at 512 x 512. You’ll just need to create an account to access your download without a watermark, but it is free. The only drawback is that files are only available as JPG or GIF – so you can’t use a PNG with a transparent background.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of the ‘free’ online tools for creating Discord server logos aren’t actually free, or they come with limitations. There are other options than using online tools to create a logo however.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Discord-Logos-and-Icons-Free-Download-Sites-2"><a href="#Part-2-Discord-Logos-and-Icons-Free-Download-Sites-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Discord Logos and Icons - Free Download Sites"></a>Part 2: Discord Logos and Icons - Free Download Sites</h2><p>Rather than creating your own logo, you might want a helping hand – these download sites let you choose an existing icon, and edit it to your own tastes.</p><h3 id="1-Icons8-2"><a href="#1-Icons8-2" class="headerlink" title="1  Icons8"></a>1  Icons8</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://icons8.com/" >Icons8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is by far the best option of all the free icon download sites. It’s really easy to use, with clear categorization to make finding the perfect logo easier. You can download each icon in PNG or SVG format (or even PDF, if you wanted to for some reason) and customize the size. You can embed the HTML directly and, if you download the Lunacy editor, make tweaks to it before you download it. It’s super simple, and the only minor drawback is you’ll need to register an account, but it’s free.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons8-discord-icons-download.jpg"                      alt=" Icons8 Discord logo Download "                ></p><h3 id="2-Iconfinder-2"><a href="#2-Iconfinder-2" class="headerlink" title="2  Iconfinder"></a>2  Iconfinder</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.iconfinder.com/" >Iconfinder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is also relatively easy to navigate, and it also lets you download a PNG or SVG version of the file in a size that you prefer. You can’t edit, nor can you embed the HTML, and many of the icons are behind a paywall.

If you want something distinct and unique, you won’t find it here. But if your Discord server is about an existing brand, you can probably download its logo here in either a vector EPS or as part of a zip file with SVG, PNG and JPG versions.

Downloads are mainly in SVG format, and again the option to browse is minimal, you’ll be relying on search terms and the categorization of icons isn’t the most intuitive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/seeklogo-discord.jpg"                      alt=" SeekLogo Discord logo Download "                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Making-A-Logo-for-Your-Discord-Server-Channel-Tips-2"><a href="#Part-3-Making-A-Logo-for-Your-Discord-Server-Channel-Tips-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Making A Logo for Your Discord Server Channel - Tips"></a>Part 3: Making A Logo for Your Discord Server Channel - Tips</h2><p>When you’re naming your server, a longer name might be harder to remember. If you can create a name that you can then abbreviate, you can include the abbreviation in your logo design, so it’s even easier to find your server. Even better, if it can be an acronym (an abbreviation that also forms its own short word) then it’ll be even more memorable.</p><p>The other key tip when creating your Discord server logo is to embrace your creativity! Don’t be scared to really make your logo stand out, especially when it’s around a topic that other Discord servers may exist for. You need to make it easy for your server logo to be understood and remembered, and a bold logo is ideal.</p><h2 id="FAQs-2"><a href="#FAQs-2" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><h4 id="1-What-is-a-Discord-Logo-2"><a href="#1-What-is-a-Discord-Logo-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

You can then edit the layout of your logo, the background, add a slogan, change the icon and more to tailor it to your exact specifications.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mybrandnewlogo-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt=" MyBrandNewLogo editing "                ></p><p>Unfortunately again you do need to sign up and pay to download your logo.

Here you dive straight in – as soon as you’ve entered your Discord server name. You will see a list of logos that you can use as a base design. So it automatically reads your server name and searches for icons related to the term. For the generated logo files, click the Custmoize button to adjust.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/auto-generated-logos.jpg"                      alt=" Logo.com interface "                ></p><p>You can then work your way down the list on the left, editing the icons to decide where you want it to live, and how big it should be. You can adjust its design, the icons on the logo, the color and the colour themes of your logo, the text, including the font and any changes to how it’s displayed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logo-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt=" Logo.com editing interface "                ></p><p>Once done, you can then preview your final logo. And yet again, you need to pay to download the full version. It’s $19.99 for a high-res PNG and JPG, but if you want a scalable Vector you need to pay $59.99 for the Starter Kit.</p><h3 id="4-BrandCrowd-3"><a href="#4-BrandCrowd-3" class="headerlink" title="4  BrandCrowd"></a>4  BrandCrowd</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.brandcrowd.com/" >BrandCrowd <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another logo creation site you could use, where again you simply enter your Discord server name and it’ll instantly generate icons for you to customize. Unlike Logo.com it doesn’t have a simple step-by-step editor, but instead it’s a lot more powerful, with various tools you can use to adjust shadows, layers and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/BrandCrowd-generated-logo-interface.jpg"                      alt=" BrandCrowd logo maker interface "                ></p><p>Once you’ve played with the editor, you can click Preview to see how it’ll look on a dummy website (or even on merch), then Download to sign up and access the files…but again they are hidden behind a paywall. BrandCrowd is one of the more expensive options too – a one off fee is $45 to get the high res PNG and JPG as well as vector files, or you can subscribe for $15 per month to unlock unlimited edits and downloads. The previews are watermarked to prevent you from just taking them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/BrandCrowd-generated-logo-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt=" BrandCrowd logo maker editing interface "                ></p><h3 id="5-Kapwing-3"><a href="#5-Kapwing-3" class="headerlink" title="5  Kapwing"></a>5  Kapwing</h3><p>The final recommendation is <a class="link"   href="https://www.kapwing.com/explore/discord-server-icon-maker-512x512-pixels" >Kapwing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Kapwing is, by far, the most comprehensive tool we’ve suggested so far. It isn’t just for creating logos, but working on all kinds of exportable content. The link we’ve included will take you straight to a dedicated workspace for Discord logos, but you’ll then need to upload all of your own imagery (although you can search Kapwing’s own resource collection) and make changes. It requires more skill, but the end results are more professional.</p><p>Using the menu at the top, you can play with text, add extra elements, or use the image tool to upload your own files or search Kapwing’s database.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-logo-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt=" Kapwing logo maker editing interface "                ></p><p>Once you’ve edited your logo, it’s already pre-set to download at 512 x 512. You’ll just need to create an account to access your download without a watermark, but it is free. The only drawback is that files are only available as JPG or GIF – so you can’t use a PNG with a transparent background.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of the ‘free’ online tools for creating Discord server logos aren’t actually free, or they come with limitations. There are other options than using online tools to create a logo however.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Discord-Logos-and-Icons-Free-Download-Sites-3"><a href="#Part-2-Discord-Logos-and-Icons-Free-Download-Sites-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Discord Logos and Icons - Free Download Sites"></a>Part 2: Discord Logos and Icons - Free Download Sites</h2><p>Rather than creating your own logo, you might want a helping hand – these download sites let you choose an existing icon, and edit it to your own tastes.</p><h3 id="1-Icons8-3"><a href="#1-Icons8-3" class="headerlink" title="1  Icons8"></a>1  Icons8</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://icons8.com/" >Icons8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is by far the best option of all the free icon download sites. It’s really easy to use, with clear categorization to make finding the perfect logo easier. You can download each icon in PNG or SVG format (or even PDF, if you wanted to for some reason) and customize the size. You can embed the HTML directly and, if you download the Lunacy editor, make tweaks to it before you download it. It’s super simple, and the only minor drawback is you’ll need to register an account, but it’s free.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons8-discord-icons-download.jpg"                      alt=" Icons8 Discord logo Download "                ></p><h3 id="2-Iconfinder-3"><a href="#2-Iconfinder-3" class="headerlink" title="2  Iconfinder"></a>2  Iconfinder</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.iconfinder.com/" >Iconfinder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is also relatively easy to navigate, and it also lets you download a PNG or SVG version of the file in a size that you prefer.

If you can create a name that you can then abbreviate, you can include the abbreviation in your logo design, so it’s even easier to find your server. Even better, if it can be an acronym (an abbreviation that also forms its own short word) then it’ll be even more memorable.</p><p>The other key tip when creating your Discord server logo is to embrace your creativity! Don’t be scared to really make your logo stand out, especially when it’s around a topic that other Discord servers may exist for. You need to make it easy for your server logo to be understood and remembered, and a bold logo is ideal.</p><h2 id="FAQs-3"><a href="#FAQs-3" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><h4 id="1-What-is-a-Discord-Logo-3"><a href="#1-What-is-a-Discord-Logo-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

For any Discord user, the servers they’re a member of are listed by logo, so making a distinctive one that is clearly associated with your server is important for helping people to easily find the server they’re looking for.</p><h4 id="2-What-is-the-Best-Size-for-Discord-Channel-Logos-3"><a href="#2-What-is-the-Best-Size-for-Discord-Channel-Logos-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

What is the Best Size for Discord Channel Logos?</h4><p>The size of your Discord logo is important, because if it’s too small then it means the logo will be poor quality, while if it’s too large then finer details just won’t be visible – the logo is only ever shown as a small icon.

Basic Things You Should Know About the Outro in a Video</h2><p>The outro is the last section of the video where the credits are displayed, such as the name of the creator, the date the video was created, and any other relevant information.</p><p>An outro is a good chance to thank your viewers for watching, promote your other videos or social channels, and maybe even sneak in a call-to-action.</p><p>Basically, the outro is the last thing your viewers will see, so it’s important to make it count!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/outros-template.png"                      alt="outros template"                ></p><h3 id="Elements-of-an-Outro"><a href="#Elements-of-an-Outro" class="headerlink" title="Elements of an Outro"></a>Elements of an Outro</h3><p>Here are a few basic elements to include in your outro to keep people engaged:</p><ul><li><strong>Subscription:</strong> Make it easy for people to subscribe to your TikTok account so they can automatically get new content as soon as it’s released. Include a call-to-action at the end of each video, telling people how they can subscribe and get the latest content.</li><li><strong>The Next Video to Watch:</strong> If you have other episodes&#x2F;parts of your TikTok videos, let people know what to expect next. This will give them a reason to come back for more.</li><li><strong>Your Social Media Channels:</strong> Let people know where they can find you on other social media platforms so they can connect with you outside of TikTok. This is a great way to build relationships with your viewers.</li><li><strong>Use Stunning Visuals:</strong> Usually, viewers skip outros just like any movie credits showing on a black screen with names on it. However, if you try to create a short TikTok outro with stunning visuals, impressive background sound, and a bit of flair, you are bound to get more followers.</li></ul><h3 id="How-To-Make-an-Advanced-Good-Outro"><a href="#How-To-Make-an-Advanced-Good-Outro" class="headerlink" title="How To Make an Advanced Good Outro?"></a>How To Make an Advanced Good Outro?</h3><p>If you want your TikTok video to go viral, you are required to have a good outro, meaning that you need to have a format that is consistent with the main body of your video, a length that is appropriate, and a call to action that is effective.</p><p>To <strong>create a good outro for your TikTok</strong>, follow the below tips:</p><ul><li>Make sure that your outro is in the same format as the rest of your TikTok video. This means that if your TikTok is mainly conversation, your outro should be as well.</li><li>Keep your outro short and sweet because you don’t want to bore your listeners with a long one. The ideal outro duration should not be more than 15 to 20 seconds.</li><li>Your outro should include a call to action. This could be something like asking your listeners to subscribe to your TikTok, follow, and share your content.</li><li>Make your outros visually appealing and make use of colors and&#x2F;or patterns that are pleasing to the eye.</li><li>Add positive words and phrases to your outros to have a good impact on your viewers.</li><li>Use branding elements like your logo or channel name.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-An-Excellent-Video-Editor-for-Your-TikTok-Adventure"><a href="#Part-2-An-Excellent-Video-Editor-for-Your-TikTok-Adventure" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Just remember that your animated logo should make an impact!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-5-social-media-logo-animation-09.jpg"                      alt="dynamic logo animation"                ></p><h3 id="05Keep-it-short-and-simple-3"><a href="#05Keep-it-short-and-simple-3" class="headerlink" title="05Keep it short and simple"></a>05Keep it short and simple</h3><p>Modern animations are simple, short but effective. Dragging it longer will just bore your audience and they might lose interest in your animated logo and your brand. When your animated logo is short and simple it will stay memorable. It is recommended to never let your animations last more than 3-4 seconds. You can of course have the logo stay on screen longer. Every millisecond in the video should be engaging and how you do that is left to your creativity. You can keep it professional or fun-filled! Be creative and make sure to think out of the box. Remember your competitors will also be thinking of animated logos, so how will you grab the attention of users is very important. Remember less is more!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-5-social-media-logo-animation-10.jpg"                      alt="short and simple logo"                ></p><p>Now that we learned about what should be considered while designing an animated logo and how to improve it, you might be wondering how can you make these animated logo videos.

Anyone can go viral and become TikTok famous by gaining more likes, lots of views, and video shares. TikTok’s algorithm can put your videos at the top of the “For You” scroll and turn you into a sensation overnight, thus skyrocketing your followers count in a matter of few days. But, did you know that TikTok removed almost 50 million videos in just 6 months because those videos violated its rules?</p><p>While this social media site can easily be your shot to fame, it can even take away your audience. Or worse, it can ban you from using the app if you do not follow its community guidelines and rules. And, if you’ve been on TikTok for a while now, chances are you’ve heard about users getting ‘shadowbanned’. It’s not unusual for users to unknowingly stop receiving likes, views, and traffic on their accounts due to <strong>TikTok shadowban</strong>.</p><p>Ever since the influx of social media, shadow banning, also known as ghost banning or stealth banning, has been around. It comes up when content has been blocked or partially blocked. Sadly, when your TikTok account is shadowbanned, it will negatively affect your reach and halt your growth. Influencers and businesses rely on social media to create a community. And when they lose a part of that community, they feel a loss of support.</p><p>Wondering what shadowbanning entails, how to determine if you’ve been shadowbanned, and <strong>how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok</strong>? Check out below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

Basically, it means your account has been banned. But, the shadow part of the term means that you won’t know about the ban.</p><p>Shadowban on TikTok is a restriction that prevents your videos from appearing on the <strong>For You</strong> page or on hashtag results. It is a situation where your visibility has been reduced or where you have been banned from the platform, without your knowledge.</p><p>The act of shadowbanning a TikTok account is an automatic process done by TikTok’s algorithm to protect other users against spam content, copyright issues, and adult content. When you get shadowbanned, you stop receiving likes, views, and traffic from the For You page. Often, shadowbans go unnoticed until another user who stumbled upon your video points it out.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban"><a href="#Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?"></a>Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?</h2><p>At the early stages of TikTok, shadowbans lasted for 24 hours. But, with the latest update in the TikTok algorithm, the length of TikTok shadowban is growing. Nowadays, a TikTok account is shadowbanned for approximately up to 2 weeks.</p><p>Within the first week, there will be a drop in your followers and so will the views. After a few days of the account shadowban being in place, you won’t be able to enter any tags or make new videos on TikTok unless they are public.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-shadowban.png"                      alt="tiktok shadowban"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?"></a>Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?</h2><p>The TikTok app doesn’t ever actually tell if you are shadowbanned. But, if you are then you can probably notice it. If you are shadowbanned, your videos will neither show up on the TikTok “For You” page nor will they appear when you search them via hashtag.</p><p>During a TikTok shadowban, your videos and content will not:</p><ul><li>be visible in the search results</li><li>be visible on the feed</li><li>receive new followers</li><li>receive likes from others</li><li>receive comments from others</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?"></a>Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok has not issued any explanation on its shadowbanning techniques. However, what makes complete sense is that TikTok shadowbans its users for creating videos that violate its community guidelines.</p><p>Any video with offensive content that can harm the sentiments of people or anything that can trigger other users can attract TikTok shadowban. The app might limit the visibility of your content for reasons such as your account acting as spam or you are posting inappropriate content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shadowbanned-on-tiktok.png"                      alt="shadowbanned on tiktok"                ></p><p><strong>Spam Behavior</strong></p><p>The primary reason why a user’s TikTok account can get shadowbanned is that they behave like a spammer. Usually, new people go on a spree of liking and following people in the hope that they will like and follow back. However, TikTok might recognize this behavior as spam and consider you as a robot.</p><p>If you like more than 100 posts daily, you might want to slow down. If you follow more than 50 TikTok accounts in a day, it is best to re-evaluate that strategy.</p><p><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong></p><p>Posting videos that go against the TikTok rules and community guidelines can get you shadowbanned or permanently banned.</p><p>The following content is considered inappropriate by TikTok:</p><ul><li>hate speech</li><li>fake news</li><li>violence</li><li>nudity</li><li>drugs</li><li>copyrighted music</li></ul><p>TikTok is committed to make its platform an inclusive and safe space. So, if you have experienced a drop in views or engagement, consider reassessing your recent content.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?"></a>Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?</h2><p>Wondering about how do you get unshadowbanned on TikTok? Here’s what you can do to remove your shadowban:</p><h4 id="Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok"><a href="#Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok"></a>Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok</h4><p>Firstly, delete your recent video. If it doesn’t work, uninstall and then reinstall the TikTok app. Sometimes, your app might just need an update to become functional once again.</p><h4 id="Switch-to-A-Pro-Account"><a href="#Switch-to-A-Pro-Account" class="headerlink" title="Switch to A Pro Account"></a>Switch to A Pro Account</h4><p>When doing a Google search on how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok, the most common tip you’ll find is to go into the Settings of your TikTok account and tap “Switch to a Pro Account”. The reason is that making the switch will allow you to see analytics for your posts and find out how people access your videos. By doing this, you can easily monitor how far your engagement has increased or dropped.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-pro-account.jpg"                      alt="tiktok pro account"                ></p><h4 id="Delete-Offensive-Content"><a href="#Delete-Offensive-Content" class="headerlink" title="Delete Offensive Content"></a>Delete Offensive Content</h4><p>You should delete content that goes against the rules and community guidelines laid down by TikTok. After deleting inappropriate content, you have to wait for at least two weeks to get the shadowban lifted. You can refresh your device once in a while to check if you have finally managed to lift the ban.</p><h4 id="Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime"><a href="#Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime" class="headerlink" title="Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime"></a>Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime</h4><p>Once you have deleted offensive content, clear the cache, close your app, ensure it is updated and then take a break from TikTok for a few days. Coming back after you have cleaned up your account and taken the needed break might get you unshadowbanned on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Post-Original-Innovative-Content"><a href="#Post-Original-Innovative-Content" class="headerlink" title="Post Original, Innovative Content"></a>Post Original, Innovative Content</h4><p>When you return to posting content, you need to make sure your TikTok account doesn’t get shadowbanned again. Your account has already been flagged for something and so you need to try even harder to behave.

Basically, it means your account has been banned. But, the shadow part of the term means that you won’t know about the ban.</p><p>Shadowban on TikTok is a restriction that prevents your videos from appearing on the <strong>For You</strong> page or on hashtag results. It is a situation where your visibility has been reduced or where you have been banned from the platform, without your knowledge.</p><p>The act of shadowbanning a TikTok account is an automatic process done by TikTok’s algorithm to protect other users against spam content, copyright issues, and adult content. When you get shadowbanned, you stop receiving likes, views, and traffic from the For You page. Often, shadowbans go unnoticed until another user who stumbled upon your video points it out.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?"></a>Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?</h2><p>At the early stages of TikTok, shadowbans lasted for 24 hours. But, with the latest update in the TikTok algorithm, the length of TikTok shadowban is growing. Nowadays, a TikTok account is shadowbanned for approximately up to 2 weeks.</p><p>Within the first week, there will be a drop in your followers and so will the views. After a few days of the account shadowban being in place, you won’t be able to enter any tags or make new videos on TikTok unless they are public.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-shadowban.png"                      alt="tiktok shadowban"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?"></a>Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?</h2><p>The TikTok app doesn’t ever actually tell if you are shadowbanned. But, if you are then you can probably notice it. If you are shadowbanned, your videos will neither show up on the TikTok “For You” page nor will they appear when you search them via hashtag.</p><p>During a TikTok shadowban, your videos and content will not:</p><ul><li>be visible in the search results</li><li>be visible on the feed</li><li>receive new followers</li><li>receive likes from others</li><li>receive comments from others</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok-1"><a href="#Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?"></a>Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok has not issued any explanation on its shadowbanning techniques. However, what makes complete sense is that TikTok shadowbans its users for creating videos that violate its community guidelines.</p><p>Any video with offensive content that can harm the sentiments of people or anything that can trigger other users can attract TikTok shadowban. The app might limit the visibility of your content for reasons such as your account acting as spam or you are posting inappropriate content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shadowbanned-on-tiktok.png"                      alt="shadowbanned on tiktok"                ></p><p><strong>Spam Behavior</strong></p><p>The primary reason why a user’s TikTok account can get shadowbanned is that they behave like a spammer. Usually, new people go on a spree of liking and following people in the hope that they will like and follow back. However, TikTok might recognize this behavior as spam and consider you as a robot.</p><p>If you like more than 100 posts daily, you might want to slow down. If you follow more than 50 TikTok accounts in a day, it is best to re-evaluate that strategy.</p><p><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong></p><p>Posting videos that go against the TikTok rules and community guidelines can get you shadowbanned or permanently banned.</p><p>The following content is considered inappropriate by TikTok:</p><ul><li>hate speech</li><li>fake news</li><li>violence</li><li>nudity</li><li>drugs</li><li>copyrighted music</li></ul><p>TikTok is committed to make its platform an inclusive and safe space. So, if you have experienced a drop in views or engagement, consider reassessing your recent content.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned-1"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?"></a>Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?</h2><p>Wondering about how do you get unshadowbanned on TikTok?

The reason is that making the switch will allow you to see analytics for your posts and find out how people access your videos.

If you go back to posting the same kind of content that got you banned in the first place, you will be booted off the stage again.</p><p>Ensure you always post original content with innovative ideas.

Anyone can go viral and become TikTok famous by gaining more likes, lots of views, and video shares. TikTok’s algorithm can put your videos at the top of the “For You” scroll and turn you into a sensation overnight, thus skyrocketing your followers count in a matter of few days. But, did you know that TikTok removed almost 50 million videos in just 6 months because those videos violated its rules?</p><p>While this social media site can easily be your shot to fame, it can even take away your audience. Or worse, it can ban you from using the app if you do not follow its community guidelines and rules. And, if you’ve been on TikTok for a while now, chances are you’ve heard about users getting ‘shadowbanned’. It’s not unusual for users to unknowingly stop receiving likes, views, and traffic on their accounts due to <strong>TikTok shadowban</strong>.</p><p>Ever since the influx of social media, shadow banning, also known as ghost banning or stealth banning, has been around. It comes up when content has been blocked or partially blocked. Sadly, when your TikTok account is shadowbanned, it will negatively affect your reach and halt your growth. Influencers and businesses rely on social media to create a community. And when they lose a part of that community, they feel a loss of support.</p><p>Wondering what shadowbanning entails, how to determine if you’ve been shadowbanned, and <strong>how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok</strong>?

A mix of lip sync videos, music, and micro-video content, TikTok is extremely popular with Gen Z. Over the years, TikTok has continued to enhance the user experience by adding new features, effects, and guidelines.</p><p>Text-to-speech is one of the newest features to be added to the popular platform and it provides an additional way to add something innovative to the video uploads.

Many find the automated voice to be a selling point in itself and something that adds a different element to the content.

The popular social media platform included the new option as an accessibility feature for users with impaired vision, a growing trend for apps integrating voice technology.</p><p>Simply put, text to speech on TikTok allows video content creators to convert any piece of text they put on top of their video into a Siri-sounding voice. This means that whatever you type will be read out loud in a robotic tone, eliminating the need for you to narrate. It is a useful way to explain your videos to add context, describe what’s happening, or serve the purpose you see fit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/text-to-speech-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="text-to-speech tiktok"                ></p><p>Source: dexerto.com</p><p>There are numerous reasons why you might decide to use this option. Firstly, it’s a great alternative for users who can’t or don’t want to use their own voice in videos. Perhaps you’re shy or just wish to keep an air of anonymity. Or, you might have a speech impediment, or communicate non-vocally or non-verbally. Either way, this feature offers a great alternative way to narrate to viewers.</p><p>Also, there are several benefits this feature provides to the audience. Some of your viewers may have poor eye-sight, might struggle to read, or are blind. Using text to speech on TikTok will help you make sure that they can still interact with your video.</p><p>Making your video more accessible means that you will get better engagement, which is a win-win situation for you. Lastly, many TikTokers use the text-to-speech option for comedic or dramatic effects.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Happened-to-TikTok-Text-To-Speech"><a href="#Part-2-What-Happened-to-TikTok-Text-To-Speech" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?"></a>Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?</h2><p>Recently, TikTok changed the voice on its text-to-speech feature to a new, more energetic, and upbeat voice. This is because of a lawsuit filed by professional voice actor Beverley Standing against ByteDance – the parent company of TikTok. Standing had sued ByteDance in mid-May for using her voice in the text-to-speech setting without her permission.</p><p>The lawsuit of the voice actor states that she was hired to work in 2018 for the state-backed Chinese Institute Of Acoustics research body to use in translations and that TikTok has used them without paying her and it has caused damage. She said she hadn’t authorized the use of her voice beyond the use for translations.</p><p>The lawsuit concerns the English-language voice used in North America. TikTok videos made prior to the change still feature the old tone. Although TikTok is yet to comment on the new voice or Standing’s lawsuit, the timing of the changes is very suggestive.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Text-To-Speech-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Text-To-Speech-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?"></a>Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?</h2><p>Are you puzzled about how to get text to speech on TikTok?

After you have the video recording you want to add the text over, press the checkmark on the lower right-hand corner of your app’s screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/start-record-video-tiktok.jpeg"                      alt="start-record video tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-3-Enter-Your-Text"><a href="#Step-3-Enter-Your-Text" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Enter Your Text"></a>Step 3: Enter Your Text</h4><p>Next, tap the text icon at the bottom of your screen and type the text you’d like to be read aloud.

The popular social media platform included the new option as an accessibility feature for users with impaired vision, a growing trend for apps integrating voice technology.</p><p>Simply put, text to speech on TikTok allows video content creators to convert any piece of text they put on top of their video into a Siri-sounding voice. This means that whatever you type will be read out loud in a robotic tone, eliminating the need for you to narrate. It is a useful way to explain your videos to add context, describe what’s happening, or serve the purpose you see fit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/text-to-speech-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="text-to-speech tiktok"                ></p><p>Source: dexerto.com</p><p>There are numerous reasons why you might decide to use this option.

Using text to speech on TikTok will help you make sure that they can still interact with your video.</p><p>Making your video more accessible means that you will get better engagement, which is a win-win situation for you.

This is because of a lawsuit filed by professional voice actor Beverley Standing against ByteDance – the parent company of TikTok. Standing had sued ByteDance in mid-May for using her voice in the text-to-speech setting without her permission.</p><p>The lawsuit of the voice actor states that she was hired to work in 2018 for the state-backed Chinese Institute Of Acoustics research body to use in translations and that TikTok has used them without paying her and it has caused damage. She said she hadn’t authorized the use of her voice beyond the use for translations.</p><p>The lawsuit concerns the English-language voice used in North America.

A mix of lip sync videos, music, and micro-video content, TikTok is extremely popular with Gen Z. Over the years, TikTok has continued to enhance the user experience by adding new features, effects, and guidelines.</p><p>Text-to-speech is one of the newest features to be added to the popular platform and it provides an additional way to add something innovative to the video uploads. Announced in December 2020, <strong>text to speech on TikTok</strong> lets creators put their text over their videos and have a Siri-like voice read it out loud.</p><p>TikTok’s text-to-speech feature was added to make the platform accessible to more people by providing an easy way for text to be heard as well as read. Consequently, using this option in video creation is one way that content creators can ensure their videos appeal to a larger number of viewers, while also offering a more comprehensive experience in general.</p><p>Since its launch, the feature has been going viral. Many find the automated voice to be a selling point in itself and something that adds a different element to the content. Also, it is a great way to get a message across without actually speaking during the video. No matter the reason it is used, the fact that many are turning to text-to-speech makes it a great addition to TikTok.</p><p>Wondering how to get the text to speech on TikTok for your next video? Here’s a detailed insight into this new feature.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Customize the Text-To-Speech Voice On TikTok?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-Text-To-Speech-Feature-On-TikTok-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-Text-To-Speech-Feature-On-TikTok-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?"></a>Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?</h2><p>In December 2020, TikTok began rolling out a new text-to-speech feature that automatically turns text into a voiceover as users watch videos that have the feature enabled. The popular social media platform included the new option as an accessibility feature for users with impaired vision, a growing trend for apps integrating voice technology.</p><p>Simply put, text to speech on TikTok allows video content creators to convert any piece of text they put on top of their video into a Siri-sounding voice. This means that whatever you type will be read out loud in a robotic tone, eliminating the need for you to narrate. It is a useful way to explain your videos to add context, describe what’s happening, or serve the purpose you see fit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/text-to-speech-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="text-to-speech tiktok"                ></p><p>Source: dexerto.com</p><p>There are numerous reasons why you might decide to use this option. Firstly, it’s a great alternative for users who can’t or don’t want to use their own voice in videos. Perhaps you’re shy or just wish to keep an air of anonymity. Or, you might have a speech impediment, or communicate non-vocally or non-verbally. Either way, this feature offers a great alternative way to narrate to viewers.</p><p>Also, there are several benefits this feature provides to the audience. Some of your viewers may have poor eye-sight, might struggle to read, or are blind. Using text to speech on TikTok will help you make sure that they can still interact with your video.</p><p>Making your video more accessible means that you will get better engagement, which is a win-win situation for you. Lastly, many TikTokers use the text-to-speech option for comedic or dramatic effects.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Happened-to-TikTok-Text-To-Speech-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-Happened-to-TikTok-Text-To-Speech-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?"></a>Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?</h2><p>Recently, TikTok changed the voice on its text-to-speech feature to a new, more energetic, and upbeat voice. This is because of a lawsuit filed by professional voice actor Beverley Standing against ByteDance – the parent company of TikTok. Standing had sued ByteDance in mid-May for using her voice in the text-to-speech setting without her permission.</p><p>The lawsuit of the voice actor states that she was hired to work in 2018 for the state-backed Chinese Institute Of Acoustics research body to use in translations and that TikTok has used them without paying her and it has caused damage. She said she hadn’t authorized the use of her voice beyond the use for translations.</p><p>The lawsuit concerns the English-language voice used in North America. TikTok videos made prior to the change still feature the old tone. Although TikTok is yet to comment on the new voice or Standing’s lawsuit, the timing of the changes is very suggestive.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Text-To-Speech-On-TikTok-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Text-To-Speech-On-TikTok-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?"></a>Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?</h2><p>Are you puzzled about how to get text to speech on TikTok? Check out the step-by-step guide below without any further ado!</p><h4 id="Step-1-Update-Your-TikTok-to-The-Latest-Version-3"><a href="#Step-1-Update-Your-TikTok-to-The-Latest-Version-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Update Your TikTok to The Latest Version"></a>Step 1: Update Your TikTok to The Latest Version</h4><p>First things first, ensure your TikTok is updated to the latest version so that you have the TikTok text-to-speech function. Many people have the natural human tendency to push updates as far as technologically possible. But, if you are perplexed about how to do text to speech on TikTok, ensure you have the latest version of this social media app before anything else.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/latest-version-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="latest version tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Start-Recording-a-Video-3"><a href="#Step-2-Start-Recording-a-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Start Recording a Video"></a>Step 2: Start Recording a Video</h4><p>Take into account what you wish to say beforehand and have a rough idea of how quickly you want it to be read as the text to speech entry can be as long as your video. After you have the video recording you want to add the text over, press the checkmark on the lower right-hand corner of your app’s screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/start-record-video-tiktok.jpeg"                      alt="start-record video tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-3-Enter-Your-Text-3"><a href="#Step-3-Enter-Your-Text-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Enter Your Text"></a>Step 3: Enter Your Text</h4><p>Next, tap the text icon at the bottom of your screen and type the text you’d like to be read aloud. Ensure you keep in mind the length. Once you have entered the text, tap ‘<strong>Done</strong>’ in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. This will insert a customizable text box over your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/enter-text-tiktok.png"                      alt="enter text tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-4-Tap-On-the-Text-Choose-Text-To-Speech-3"><a href="#Step-4-Tap-On-the-Text-Choose-Text-To-Speech-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Tap On the Text, Choose Text-To-Speech"></a>Step 4: Tap On the Text, Choose Text-To-Speech</h4><p>When it comes to using text to speech on TikTok, this is another crucial step.Once you enter the text into the TikTok video, tap the Textbox and you will have three options: Text-to-Speech, Set Duration, and Edit. Select Text-to-Speech and the inbuilt text-to-speech AI of TikTok will read your text over the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tap-text-to-speech-tiktok.png"                      alt="tap-text-to speech tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-5-Save-the-Video-Locally-3"><a href="#Step-5-Save-the-Video-Locally-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Save the Video Locally"></a>Step 5: Save the Video Locally</h4><p>It is here that you will venture outside TikTok to change the text-to-speech voice. Once your video is ready in every other way, consider saving it locally on your device and not post it for everyone to see. Ensure the “<strong>Save to Device</strong>” option is active and you can post it privately.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/save-to-device-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="save-to device tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-6-Download-A-Video-Editor-with-Voice-Modifiers-3"><a href="#Step-6-Download-A-Video-Editor-with-Voice-Modifiers-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Download A Video Editor with Voice Modifiers"></a>Step 6: Download A Video Editor with Voice Modifiers</h4><p>Next, you have to download a video editor – ideally for your smartphone – with voice modifiers. Adding ‘video’ into the search keywords alongside ‘Voice Modifier’ or ‘Voice Changer’ will bring up a list of options. Remember; many voice changers or free editors will either block the option to save edited videos onto the device behind a paywall or leave a watermark.</p><h4 id="Step-7-Edit-the-Video-and-Resave-3"><a href="#Step-7-Edit-the-Video-and-Resave-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 7: Edit the Video and Resave"></a>Step 7: Edit the Video and Resave</h4><p>Once you have chosen your video editor, launch it and import your saved TikTok video. Here, you can edit the audio just like any other video, and voice modifiers can be applied if the video editing tool you choose has them. Apply different effects you’d like and resave your new and modified TikTok video to your device.</p><h4 id="Step-8-Upload-as-A-New-Video-to-TikTok-3"><a href="#Step-8-Upload-as-A-New-Video-to-TikTok-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 8: Upload as A New Video to TikTok"></a>Step 8: Upload as A New Video to TikTok</h4><p>Open the TikTok app and upload the new, edited TikTok as a singular video directly, without any further edits.

Anyone can go viral and become TikTok famous by gaining more likes, lots of views, and video shares. TikTok’s algorithm can put your videos at the top of the “For You” scroll and turn you into a sensation overnight, thus skyrocketing your followers count in a matter of few days. But, did you know that TikTok removed almost 50 million videos in just 6 months because those videos violated its rules?</p><p>While this social media site can easily be your shot to fame, it can even take away your audience. Or worse, it can ban you from using the app if you do not follow its community guidelines and rules. And, if you’ve been on TikTok for a while now, chances are you’ve heard about users getting ‘shadowbanned’. It’s not unusual for users to unknowingly stop receiving likes, views, and traffic on their accounts due to <strong>TikTok shadowban</strong>.</p><p>Ever since the influx of social media, shadow banning, also known as ghost banning or stealth banning, has been around. It comes up when content has been blocked or partially blocked. Sadly, when your TikTok account is shadowbanned, it will negatively affect your reach and halt your growth. Influencers and businesses rely on social media to create a community. And when they lose a part of that community, they feel a loss of support.</p><p>Wondering what shadowbanning entails, how to determine if you’ve been shadowbanned, and <strong>how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok</strong>? Check out below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

Basically, it means your account has been banned. But, the shadow part of the term means that you won’t know about the ban.</p><p>Shadowban on TikTok is a restriction that prevents your videos from appearing on the <strong>For You</strong> page or on hashtag results. It is a situation where your visibility has been reduced or where you have been banned from the platform, without your knowledge.</p><p>The act of shadowbanning a TikTok account is an automatic process done by TikTok’s algorithm to protect other users against spam content, copyright issues, and adult content. When you get shadowbanned, you stop receiving likes, views, and traffic from the For You page. Often, shadowbans go unnoticed until another user who stumbled upon your video points it out.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban"><a href="#Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?"></a>Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?</h2><p>At the early stages of TikTok, shadowbans lasted for 24 hours. But, with the latest update in the TikTok algorithm, the length of TikTok shadowban is growing. Nowadays, a TikTok account is shadowbanned for approximately up to 2 weeks.</p><p>Within the first week, there will be a drop in your followers and so will the views. After a few days of the account shadowban being in place, you won’t be able to enter any tags or make new videos on TikTok unless they are public.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-shadowban.png"                      alt="tiktok shadowban"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?"></a>Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?</h2><p>The TikTok app doesn’t ever actually tell if you are shadowbanned. But, if you are then you can probably notice it. If you are shadowbanned, your videos will neither show up on the TikTok “For You” page nor will they appear when you search them via hashtag.</p><p>During a TikTok shadowban, your videos and content will not:</p><ul><li>be visible in the search results</li><li>be visible on the feed</li><li>receive new followers</li><li>receive likes from others</li><li>receive comments from others</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?"></a>Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok has not issued any explanation on its shadowbanning techniques. However, what makes complete sense is that TikTok shadowbans its users for creating videos that violate its community guidelines.</p><p>Any video with offensive content that can harm the sentiments of people or anything that can trigger other users can attract TikTok shadowban. The app might limit the visibility of your content for reasons such as your account acting as spam or you are posting inappropriate content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shadowbanned-on-tiktok.png"                      alt="shadowbanned on tiktok"                ></p><p><strong>Spam Behavior</strong></p><p>The primary reason why a user’s TikTok account can get shadowbanned is that they behave like a spammer. Usually, new people go on a spree of liking and following people in the hope that they will like and follow back. However, TikTok might recognize this behavior as spam and consider you as a robot.</p><p>If you like more than 100 posts daily, you might want to slow down. If you follow more than 50 TikTok accounts in a day, it is best to re-evaluate that strategy.</p><p><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong></p><p>Posting videos that go against the TikTok rules and community guidelines can get you shadowbanned or permanently banned.</p><p>The following content is considered inappropriate by TikTok:</p><ul><li>hate speech</li><li>fake news</li><li>violence</li><li>nudity</li><li>drugs</li><li>copyrighted music</li></ul><p>TikTok is committed to make its platform an inclusive and safe space. So, if you have experienced a drop in views or engagement, consider reassessing your recent content.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?"></a>Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?</h2><p>Wondering about how do you get unshadowbanned on TikTok? Here’s what you can do to remove your shadowban:</p><h4 id="Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok"><a href="#Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok"></a>Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok</h4><p>Firstly, delete your recent video. If it doesn’t work, uninstall and then reinstall the TikTok app. Sometimes, your app might just need an update to become functional once again.</p><h4 id="Switch-to-A-Pro-Account"><a href="#Switch-to-A-Pro-Account" class="headerlink" title="Switch to A Pro Account"></a>Switch to A Pro Account</h4><p>When doing a Google search on how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok, the most common tip you’ll find is to go into the Settings of your TikTok account and tap “Switch to a Pro Account”. The reason is that making the switch will allow you to see analytics for your posts and find out how people access your videos. By doing this, you can easily monitor how far your engagement has increased or dropped.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-pro-account.jpg"                      alt="tiktok pro account"                ></p><h4 id="Delete-Offensive-Content"><a href="#Delete-Offensive-Content" class="headerlink" title="Delete Offensive Content"></a>Delete Offensive Content</h4><p>You should delete content that goes against the rules and community guidelines laid down by TikTok. After deleting inappropriate content, you have to wait for at least two weeks to get the shadowban lifted. You can refresh your device once in a while to check if you have finally managed to lift the ban.</p><h4 id="Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime"><a href="#Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime" class="headerlink" title="Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime"></a>Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime</h4><p>Once you have deleted offensive content, clear the cache, close your app, ensure it is updated and then take a break from TikTok for a few days. Coming back after you have cleaned up your account and taken the needed break might get you unshadowbanned on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Post-Original-Innovative-Content"><a href="#Post-Original-Innovative-Content" class="headerlink" title="Post Original, Innovative Content"></a>Post Original, Innovative Content</h4><p>When you return to posting content, you need to make sure your TikTok account doesn’t get shadowbanned again. Your account has already been flagged for something and so you need to try even harder to behave. If you go back to posting the same kind of content that got you banned in the first place, you will be booted off the stage again.</p><p>Ensure you always post original content with innovative ideas. Brainstorm new ideas with your team and come up with something new and unique. This way, you can avoid copyright infringement laws on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Know-Your-Audience-More"><a href="#Know-Your-Audience-More" class="headerlink" title="Know Your Audience More"></a>Know Your Audience More</h4><p>These days, there are many kids and minor accounts on TikTok, and maintaining a healthy environment is a part of your responsibility. Keep your videos free from sexualized themes, nudity, pornographic material, and suggestive themes. Remember; posting such content can land you in serious trouble with TikTok shadowban.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Use-Excellent-Video-Editors-to-Make-Amazing-TikTok-Videos"><a href="#Part-6-Use-Excellent-Video-Editors-to-Make-Amazing-TikTok-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Use Excellent Video Editors to Make Amazing TikTok Videos"></a>Part 6: Use Excellent Video Editors to Make Amazing TikTok Videos</h2><p>With increasing competition among TikTok users, it is important to use a powerful video editing tool to make your TikTok videos stand out.

Basically, it means your account has been banned. But, the shadow part of the term means that you won’t know about the ban.</p><p>Shadowban on TikTok is a restriction that prevents your videos from appearing on the <strong>For You</strong> page or on hashtag results. It is a situation where your visibility has been reduced or where you have been banned from the platform, without your knowledge.</p><p>The act of shadowbanning a TikTok account is an automatic process done by TikTok’s algorithm to protect other users against spam content, copyright issues, and adult content. When you get shadowbanned, you stop receiving likes, views, and traffic from the For You page. Often, shadowbans go unnoticed until another user who stumbled upon your video points it out.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?"></a>Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?</h2><p>At the early stages of TikTok, shadowbans lasted for 24 hours. But, with the latest update in the TikTok algorithm, the length of TikTok shadowban is growing. Nowadays, a TikTok account is shadowbanned for approximately up to 2 weeks.</p><p>Within the first week, there will be a drop in your followers and so will the views. After a few days of the account shadowban being in place, you won’t be able to enter any tags or make new videos on TikTok unless they are public.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-shadowban.png"                      alt="tiktok shadowban"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?"></a>Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?</h2><p>The TikTok app doesn’t ever actually tell if you are shadowbanned. But, if you are then you can probably notice it. If you are shadowbanned, your videos will neither show up on the TikTok “For You” page nor will they appear when you search them via hashtag.</p><p>During a TikTok shadowban, your videos and content will not:</p><ul><li>be visible in the search results</li><li>be visible on the feed</li><li>receive new followers</li><li>receive likes from others</li><li>receive comments from others</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok-1"><a href="#Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?"></a>Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok has not issued any explanation on its shadowbanning techniques. However, what makes complete sense is that TikTok shadowbans its users for creating videos that violate its community guidelines.</p><p>Any video with offensive content that can harm the sentiments of people or anything that can trigger other users can attract TikTok shadowban. The app might limit the visibility of your content for reasons such as your account acting as spam or you are posting inappropriate content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shadowbanned-on-tiktok.png"                      alt="shadowbanned on tiktok"                ></p><p><strong>Spam Behavior</strong></p><p>The primary reason why a user’s TikTok account can get shadowbanned is that they behave like a spammer. Usually, new people go on a spree of liking and following people in the hope that they will like and follow back. However, TikTok might recognize this behavior as spam and consider you as a robot.</p><p>If you like more than 100 posts daily, you might want to slow down. If you follow more than 50 TikTok accounts in a day, it is best to re-evaluate that strategy.</p><p><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong></p><p>Posting videos that go against the TikTok rules and community guidelines can get you shadowbanned or permanently banned.</p><p>The following content is considered inappropriate by TikTok:</p><ul><li>hate speech</li><li>fake news</li><li>violence</li><li>nudity</li><li>drugs</li><li>copyrighted music</li></ul><p>TikTok is committed to make its platform an inclusive and safe space. So, if you have experienced a drop in views or engagement, consider reassessing your recent content.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned-1"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?"></a>Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?</h2><p>Wondering about how do you get unshadowbanned on TikTok? Here’s what you can do to remove your shadowban:</p><h4 id="Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok-1"><a href="#Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok-1" class="headerlink" title="Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok"></a>Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok</h4><p>Firstly, delete your recent video. If it doesn’t work, uninstall and then reinstall the TikTok app. Sometimes, your app might just need an update to become functional once again.</p><h4 id="Switch-to-A-Pro-Account-1"><a href="#Switch-to-A-Pro-Account-1" class="headerlink" title="Switch to A Pro Account"></a>Switch to A Pro Account</h4><p>When doing a Google search on how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok, the most common tip you’ll find is to go into the Settings of your TikTok account and tap “Switch to a Pro Account”. The reason is that making the switch will allow you to see analytics for your posts and find out how people access your videos. By doing this, you can easily monitor how far your engagement has increased or dropped.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-pro-account.jpg"                      alt="tiktok pro account"                ></p><h4 id="Delete-Offensive-Content-1"><a href="#Delete-Offensive-Content-1" class="headerlink" title="Delete Offensive Content"></a>Delete Offensive Content</h4><p>You should delete content that goes against the rules and community guidelines laid down by TikTok. After deleting inappropriate content, you have to wait for at least two weeks to get the shadowban lifted. You can refresh your device once in a while to check if you have finally managed to lift the ban.</p><h4 id="Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime-1"><a href="#Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime-1" class="headerlink" title="Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime"></a>Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime</h4><p>Once you have deleted offensive content, clear the cache, close your app, ensure it is updated and then take a break from TikTok for a few days. Coming back after you have cleaned up your account and taken the needed break might get you unshadowbanned on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Post-Original-Innovative-Content-1"><a href="#Post-Original-Innovative-Content-1" class="headerlink" title="Post Original, Innovative Content"></a>Post Original, Innovative Content</h4><p>When you return to posting content, you need to make sure your TikTok account doesn’t get shadowbanned again. Your account has already been flagged for something and so you need to try even harder to behave. If you go back to posting the same kind of content that got you banned in the first place, you will be booted off the stage again.</p><p>Ensure you always post original content with innovative ideas. Brainstorm new ideas with your team and come up with something new and unique. This way, you can avoid copyright infringement laws on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Know-Your-Audience-More-1"><a href="#Know-Your-Audience-More-1" class="headerlink" title="Know Your Audience More"></a>Know Your Audience More</h4><p>These days, there are many kids and minor accounts on TikTok, and maintaining a healthy environment is a part of your responsibility. Keep your videos free from sexualized themes, nudity, pornographic material, and suggestive themes. Remember; posting such content can land you in serious trouble with TikTok shadowban.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Use-Excellent-Video-Editors-to-Make-Amazing-TikTok-Videos-1"><a href="#Part-6-Use-Excellent-Video-Editors-to-Make-Amazing-TikTok-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Use Excellent Video Editors to Make Amazing TikTok Videos"></a>Part 6: Use Excellent Video Editors to Make Amazing TikTok Videos</h2><p>With increasing competition among TikTok users, it is important to use a powerful video editing tool to make your TikTok videos stand out.

If you go back to posting the same kind of content that got you banned in the first place, you will be booted off the stage again.</p><p>Ensure you always post original content with innovative ideas.

Anyone can go viral and become TikTok famous by gaining more likes, lots of views, and video shares. TikTok’s algorithm can put your videos at the top of the “For You” scroll and turn you into a sensation overnight, thus skyrocketing your followers count in a matter of few days. But, did you know that TikTok removed almost 50 million videos in just 6 months because those videos violated its rules?</p><p>While this social media site can easily be your shot to fame, it can even take away your audience. Or worse, it can ban you from using the app if you do not follow its community guidelines and rules. And, if you’ve been on TikTok for a while now, chances are you’ve heard about users getting ‘shadowbanned’. It’s not unusual for users to unknowingly stop receiving likes, views, and traffic on their accounts due to <strong>TikTok shadowban</strong>.</p><p>Ever since the influx of social media, shadow banning, also known as ghost banning or stealth banning, has been around. It comes up when content has been blocked or partially blocked. Sadly, when your TikTok account is shadowbanned, it will negatively affect your reach and halt your growth. Influencers and businesses rely on social media to create a community. And when they lose a part of that community, they feel a loss of support.</p><p>Wondering what shadowbanning entails, how to determine if you’ve been shadowbanned, and <strong>how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok</strong>?

TikTok now seems to be a part of everyone’s life through the most popular lip-syncing videos, one-act dance routines, 1-min recipes, funny clips, and stuff like the bottle cap challenge.</p><p>More or less the heart and soul of today’s teenagers and young adults, and sometimes even senior citizens, TikTok now has over 1 billion users and became the World’s 7th most downloaded app, all within a span of 3years since its release in 2016.</p><p>What started with fun and games has become a serious platform to showcase one’s talent and gain followers, earn money, and even stardom. Such provisions have stirred fierce competition among influencers, for what seems like the Wars of Creativity to publish more and more viral-worthy videos.</p><p>If you are an influencer looking for new and amazing <strong>TikTok ideas</strong> to make your videos go viral, then here is a stimulus.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: TikTok vs YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers</a></li></ul><h2 id="TikTok-vs-YouTube"><a href="#TikTok-vs-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="TikTok vs YouTube"></a>TikTok vs YouTube</h2><p>TikTok may be one of a kind, but it is not the only platform where you can publish your mobile-made videos without much ado. The protagonist of that story is still, YouTube. TikTok being a game-changer in the scene, is giving maximum competition to all other social networks and digital platforms that deal with video-sharing, such as Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. But the tiff between YouTube and TikTok surpasses all other competitions because only these two are all about Videos.</p><h4 id="Nature-of-Content"><a href="#Nature-of-Content" class="headerlink" title="Nature of Content"></a>Nature of Content</h4><p>The main difference between YouTube and TikTok is the nature of the content. YouTube is a broader spectrum than TikTok, for it contains feature-length movies, episodes of off-air Television Series, music videos, podcasts, and personal videos is just a part of it. But TikTok revolves around short video clips. And just that.</p><h4 id="User-Base"><a href="#User-Base" class="headerlink" title="User Base"></a>User Base</h4><p>TikTok has a niche user base, with the majority of users between 16 and 25 yo. Meanwhile, YouTube reserves a universal user base, catering to people of all ages and from different walks of life.</p><h4 id="Outreach"><a href="#Outreach" class="headerlink" title="Outreach"></a>Outreach</h4><p>TikTok is primarily a casual, youth-centric platform. While it is useful for highlighting one’s talent and engaging a loyal fanbase, it is not ideal for business promotion, or to present a show in a traditional way, which is a substantial offering of YouTube. But on the flip side, due to the vastness of YouTube, short and casual videos like the ones typically available in TikTok, have limited scope to go viral.</p><p>Therefore, the difference between TikTok and YouTube is like Apples and Oranges. They are both fruits and are sweet. But are different species with different tastes.</p><h2 id="Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers"><a href="#Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers"></a>Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers</h2><h4 id="1-Music-Videos"><a href="#1-Music-Videos" class="headerlink" title="1. Music Videos"></a>1. Music Videos</h4><p>A common theme of most viral TikTok videos is they tend to be cute and cuddly. As part of music videos, you are required to imitate certain adorable songs by performing their actions either using your hands or by putting your whole body into action. These songs can be typically found in the trending section of the app and it does not take much effort to figure out the ones that are high in popularity. The catch here is that you need to be among the frontrunners in terms of covering these songs so that you can find yourself a large captive audience to influence at the earliest.</p><p>Here is an example of <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsPbFnhZQ/" >a girl showing off her TikTok music video skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2-Dance-Videos"><a href="#2-Dance-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2. Dance Videos"></a>2. Dance Videos</h4><p>If it is short, funny, and uses the correct hashtags, your dance video can create a lot of influence among your followers. Oh, and don’t forget to pair them up with the correct background score. A song that is already trending and popular on the social platform will only boost your video’s chances of a hit. A short and easy dance always does the business, even better if it can be used for a meme.</p><p>This is a good example of what <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsN-RFmQn/" >your dance video should look like <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Now isn’t that the perfect ingredient for the next viral meme on the market!</p><h4 id="3-Calming-Videos"><a href="#3-Calming-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Calming Videos"></a>3. Calming Videos</h4><p>Just because it’s a TikTok video doesn’t mean that it has to be over-the-top and loud. Sometimes, keeping things simple is the secret to success. Calming videos are those where something that most would otherwise consider weird or mundane exerts a feeling of calm on the viewer. Most social media platforms have helped such videos gain immense popularity but finding the right explanation of what these pertain to is a pretty difficult task.</p><p>Look at this video of <a class="link"   href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/705446729114378862/" >color droplets being sprayed from the tip of a brush <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Did that not calm your mind?</p><h4 id="4-Objects-Singing-Videos"><a href="#4-Objects-Singing-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4. Objects Singing Videos"></a>4.

The protagonist of that story is still, YouTube. TikTok being a game-changer in the scene, is giving maximum competition to all other social networks and digital platforms that deal with video-sharing, such as Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. But the tiff between YouTube and TikTok surpasses all other competitions because only these two are all about Videos.</p><h4 id="Nature-of-Content-3"><a href="#Nature-of-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="Nature of Content"></a>Nature of Content</h4><p>The main difference between YouTube and TikTok is the nature of the content. YouTube is a broader spectrum than TikTok, for it contains feature-length movies, episodes of off-air Television Series, music videos, podcasts, and personal videos is just a part of it. But TikTok revolves around short video clips. And just that.</p><h4 id="User-Base-3"><a href="#User-Base-3" class="headerlink" title="User Base"></a>User Base</h4><p>TikTok has a niche user base, with the majority of users between 16 and 25 yo. Meanwhile, YouTube reserves a universal user base, catering to people of all ages and from different walks of life.</p><h4 id="Outreach-3"><a href="#Outreach-3" class="headerlink" title="Outreach"></a>Outreach</h4><p>TikTok is primarily a casual, youth-centric platform. While it is useful for highlighting one’s talent and engaging a loyal fanbase, it is not ideal for business promotion, or to present a show in a traditional way, which is a substantial offering of YouTube. But on the flip side, due to the vastness of YouTube, short and casual videos like the ones typically available in TikTok, have limited scope to go viral.</p><p>Therefore, the difference between TikTok and YouTube is like Apples and Oranges. They are both fruits and are sweet. But are different species with different tastes.</p><h2 id="Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers-3"><a href="#Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers-3" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers"></a>Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers</h2><h4 id="1-Music-Videos-3"><a href="#1-Music-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

As part of music videos, you are required to imitate certain adorable songs by performing their actions either using your hands or by putting your whole body into action. These songs can be typically found in the trending section of the app and it does not take much effort to figure out the ones that are high in popularity. The catch here is that you need to be among the frontrunners in terms of covering these songs so that you can find yourself a large captive audience to influence at the earliest.</p><p>Here is an example of <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsPbFnhZQ/" >a girl showing off her TikTok music video skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2-Dance-Videos-3"><a href="#2-Dance-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

A short and easy dance always does the business, even better if it can be used for a meme.</p><p>This is a good example of what <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsN-RFmQn/" >your dance video should look like <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

But what’s this? Your video gets muted or taken down! What a bummer!</p><p>The reason?</p><p>Copyright infringement, or in simple words, using music without the permission of the singer!</p><p>This includes external sounds that are not a part of the TikTok library.</p><p>So, what should we do to avoid this, you ask?</p><p>To avoid this, you need to learn how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading.</p><p>And, in this article, we will tell you exactly why you need to follow TikTok copyright, and how to check it before posting a video.</p><h2 id="Why-Do-You-Need-to-Follow-Tiktok-Copyright"><a href="#Why-Do-You-Need-to-Follow-Tiktok-Copyright" class="headerlink" title="Why Do You Need to Follow Tiktok Copyright?"></a><strong>Why Do You Need to Follow Tiktok Copyright?</strong></h2><p>To avoid getting banned!</p><p>You see, TikTok has a vast library of sounds with proper legal authorization that is available for the users to use in their videos. However, sometimes people use their own music in the videos.</p><p>The external sound may or may not be copyrighted.</p><p>If it does not have any copyrights on it, all is good. But in case you accidentally use a copyrighted video, TikTok automatically detects it, and either mutes your video or takes it down entirely. If the copyright is detected while posting, the platform will prevent you from uploading it in the first place.</p><p>To be on the safe side, we recommend using sounds already present in the TikTok library.</p><p>But, what if you want to use an external sound? Is there a way to check TikTok video copyright before uploading?</p><p>Yes, there is! And in the next section, we will tell you all about it.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Check-Tiktok-Video-Copyright-Before-Uploading"><a href="#Check-Tiktok-Video-Copyright-Before-Uploading" class="headerlink" title="Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading"></a><strong>Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading</strong></h2><p>Whenever you’re posting a video to TikTok, you get the option of running a copyright check on it.

But, TikTok is much more addictive than Facebook and Instagram. People on TikTok spend 55 minutes on the app on average. This is very interesting since it depicts the great potential for marketers.</p><p>Mostly, TikTok users spend their time in binge-watching videos.

Check out below to know more.</p><p>President Donald Trump on August 5, 2020, issued executive orders announcing that he is banning Chinese-owned TikTok from U.S. app stores. The drastic move comes months after the Trump administration first teased the idea of outlawing this immensely popular video-sharing app due to national security concerns.</p><p>U.S. officials are concerned that this Chinese-owned and operated app can potentially pass on US users’ data to the Chinese government. And, with TikTok facing uncertainty in the U.S. between being banned or bought by an American company, many predict Likee may soon surpass TikTok. This has sparked the debate of Likee vs. TikTok.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/likee-vs-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Likee Vs Tiktok"                ></p><p>With TikTok mired in uncertainty in the US, users are jumping to other video-sharing apps. The continual privacy concerns over TikTok may have opened the window for competitors such as Likee to try seizing the opportunity and take the social media throne. But, so far it hasn’t been successful in surpassing TikTok since the app is at least 50 million weekly active users behind TikTok.</p><p>Here’s a detailed insight on Likee vs. TikTok.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Will Likee Surpass TikTok?</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-Is-Likee-What-Is-TikTok-3"><a href="#What-Is-Likee-What-Is-TikTok-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?"></a>What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?</h2><h4 id="Likee-3"><a href="#Likee-3" class="headerlink" title="Likee"></a>Likee</h4><p>Launched in the year 2017, Likee allows users to create short videos easily with intuitive editing tools. Formerly known as ‘Like’, this photo and video editing app give users the freedom to experiment on their videos and photos as much as they want. Just like TikTok, Likee is a social video platform that provides several fun ways to create music videos, short videos, and recreate famous scenes from movies, as well as share funny moments with followers. The app utilizes an artificial intelligence algorithm for exact content recommendations for its users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/likee.png"                      alt="Likee Features"                ></p><h4 id="TikTok-3"><a href="#TikTok-3" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h4><p>Released in September 2016, TikTok is the most popular short-form, video-sharing app. Often referred to as a “lip-syncing” app, it gives users the freedom to create and share 15-second mobile videos on any topic. It is a fun and entertaining app that has emerged as one of the biggest marketing and social networking platforms today.</p><h2 id="Who-Uses-Likee-TikTok-3"><a href="#Who-Uses-Likee-TikTok-3" class="headerlink" title="Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?"></a>Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?</h2><p>Likee is one of the many social-video sharing apps that have been making waves worldwide amid the privacy concerns and the ban imposed by the Trump administration on TikTok. The app is best for older teens and young adults. The app is ideal for users who love singing and dancing. Also, the app lets users star in their own music video and then share them online.</p><p>For teenagers who understand what’s apt to post in social media, can keep negative comments in perspective, and are prepared for some mature comment, Likee provides a great deal of entertainment and opportunities to show off creativity. The app has a 17+ age restriction.</p><p>Just like Likee, teenagers and younger people are the main users of TikTok. It is used by GenZ as a platform to express their creativity.

This trend started on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and has spread to other social media like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >TikTok <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. TikTok has already conquered the Asian market, but in recent years this video-sharing and social networking app is becoming popular across the globe.</p><p>Standing out from TikTok isn’t as easy as you thought, because you will face fierce competition, and you must do everything you can to improve the quality of the content you share on TikTok. So, in this article, we will look at the best TikTok video editing apps that will enable you to produce content that attracts millions of viewers.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-the-TikTok’s-Built-in-Video-Editing-Tools"><a href="#How-to-Use-the-TikTok’s-Built-in-Video-Editing-Tools" class="headerlink" title="How to Use the TikTok’s Built-in Video Editing Tools"></a>How to Use the TikTok’s Built-in Video Editing Tools</h2><p>In addition to viewing the content posted by other TikTok users, the app lets you record and edit videos. The video editing tools you are going to have at your disposal are basic but still powerful enough to enable you to enhance the 15 and 60-second videos you capture with TikTok.</p><p>To start making a new video, you have to tap on the + icon that is located at the bottom of the app’s home screen and then tap on the red Video button on the app’s Shooting page. Before you start recording, tap on the Add a Sound option if you would like to choose a song or an audio effect you would like to add to a video you’re creating.</p><p>Adding Texts in TikTok Video with TikTok: By Rhia</p><p>Moreover, the app lets you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >control the video’s playback speed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, apply filters and effects or activate the Beauty mode before you start shooting. As we already noted, a video you record with TikTok cannot be longer than 60 seconds.

And the first place to begin with that aim is in your TikTok bio.</p><p>Your bio for TikTok is your best chance to introduce yourself and your brand to each of your potential followers.</p><p>It’s because you don’t want to consume time to introduce yourself in every video, again and again, so your <strong>TikTok bios</strong> provide you with the opportunity to do just that. This is your chance to describe to your followers who you are and why they should be your followers.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p>Here, we’ll cover how to add a link to TikTok bio, 30+ TikTok bio ideas, and other fantastic tools to upgrade your TikTok profile.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Optimize Your TikTok Bio in 5 Easy Steps [updated 2024]</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: 30+ TikTok Bio Ideas in 2024</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Top 5 TikTok Bio Fonts Generators of 2024</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Best TikTok Tools for Video Editing</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Optimize-Your-TikTok-Bio-in-5-Easy-Steps-updated-2024"><a href="#Part-1-Optimize-Your-TikTok-Bio-in-5-Easy-Steps-updated-2024" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Optimize Your TikTok Bio in 5 Easy Steps [updated 2024]"></a>Part 1: Optimize Your TikTok Bio in 5 Easy Steps [updated 2024]</h2><p>Writing a TikTok bio doesn’t have to be that hard. You have to go through the five easy steps to create a bio for TikTok that will help you be successful. So, let’s dig deeper into those ultimate steps!</p><p><strong>Step 1: Describe your brand.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/describe-account-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="describe account tiktok"                ></p><p>Source: blog.hubspot.com</p><p>Describe your followers who you are and what you do. They may gather some idea of what your profile is about, based on your content. Still, it would help if you didn’t rely on that.</p><p>What if you create a video relevant to you but has nothing to do with your account? Your visitors need to learn another way to know what your business is all about.</p><p>It can be only a few words, so make sure you boil down what people want to know. And ensure your language is compelling, engaging, and gets across your account’s purpose efficiently.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Add emojis.</strong></p><p>Almost every TikTok bio contains an emoji that help you emphasize your brand’s personality and showcase your brand’s services and products without consuming much space in your TikTok bio.</p><p>For example, if you work for an eCommerce brand, particularly in clothing, you might enter a t-shirt emoji (???). Or, if your company sells video tools, you may enter a video camera emoji (???).</p><p>So, these emojis tell people what to do. And, if you want them to hit the follow button or click the link below, you could add arrows to express that without entering extra characters to influence visitors’ action.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Add a CTA.</strong></p><p>Like any attractive social media bio, you should have a CTA in your TikTok bio as well. It exactly tells your visitors what to do next. For example, you might add a CTA to direct followers to an eCommerce website, a blog post link, or another social channel like YouTube or Instagram.</p><p>Always think of including a CTA in almost every video or communication you share with your potential followers.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Don’t exceed the character limit</strong>.</p><p>TikTok has a bio character limit which is further not very big. So you only have 80 characters to summarize your TikTok bio. That’s just over half of the limit present on Instagram handles, which can be pretty tight, one of the factors emojis are super helpful. You can easily save your characters and use them wisely to communicate your brand among the followers fully. Then, pick out the most crucial angles of your brand and showcase those in your TikTok bio.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Add a link in your TikTok bio.</strong></p><p>TikTok gives you a link adding space as well, so if it’s currently accessible in your account, you should use it. And, we’ll also discuss how to add a link to TikTok’s bio, an excellent method to direct traffic off the platform to other promotion pages.</p><p>So, you can direct them to a relevant landing page or e-book and capture their contact info or an email address, or you can share the sales page for the most current product you touted in your video.</p><p>Thus, there are numerous ways you can optimize your TikTok bio ideas.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Link-to-TikTok-Bio"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Link-to-TikTok-Bio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?"></a>Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?</h2><p>First, to know how to add a link to TikTok bio, you can send traffic to only a single URL. You can select your most recent blog post, a dedicated landing page, your homepage, social media profile, or any other page you’d like.</p><p>The other way is to promote multiple links through a bio service. With this type of service, people can get directed to a web page with a collection of page links to visit.</p><p>You could include affiliate links, blog links, products, or even your other social media handles. Using a TikTok bio link service helps you to give your visitors more ways of connecting with people outside of TikTok.</p><p><strong>Accessing the Link in Bio on TikTok</strong></p><p>Yet, there is a caveat to the <strong>TikTok bio</strong> link option: not everyone can add a link to their <strong>TikTok bio</strong>. Most Android users have this option, while some iOS users are still waiting. Follow the steps below to check:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Hit the <strong>“Edit your profile”</strong> tab</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Check for the option “<strong>Website</strong>“ underneath the section to edit TikTok bio.</p><p>There’s no issue if you don’t have that option. You can join the TikTok Testers program by easily downloading a separate app called <strong>Testflight</strong> through the app store.</p><p>Next, open your current TikTok app and tap the three dots in your profile page’s upper right-hand corner to enter the “<strong>Settings</strong>“ window. Then, scroll down and click <strong>“Join TikTok Testers.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-beta.jpg"                      alt="tiktok beta"                ></p><p>Follow those instructions, and you’ll be able to access the different Beta versions of TikTok after they get released. TikTok provides this facility to ensure that only the best features hit the primary app and keep the app as bug-free as possible.</p><h2 id="Part-3-30-TikTok-Bio-Ideas-in-2024"><a href="#Part-3-30-TikTok-Bio-Ideas-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 30+ TikTok Bio Ideas in 2024"></a>Part 3: 30+ TikTok Bio Ideas in 2024</h2><p>Light travels faster than sound. That’s why people look bright until they speak.</p><p>Time is relevant. Waste it genuinely</p><p>Hey, are you on my bio again?</p><p>I learn from the mistakes of others who took my advice.</p><p>Wait, where am I?

You have to go through the five easy steps to create a bio for TikTok that will help you be successful. So, let’s dig deeper into those ultimate steps!</p><p><strong>Step 1: Describe your brand.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/describe-account-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="describe account tiktok"                ></p><p>Source: blog.hubspot.com</p><p>Describe your followers who you are and what you do. They may gather some idea of what your profile is about, based on your content. Still, it would help if you didn’t rely on that.</p><p>What if you create a video relevant to you but has nothing to do with your account? Your visitors need to learn another way to know what your business is all about.</p><p>It can be only a few words, so make sure you boil down what people want to know. And ensure your language is compelling, engaging, and gets across your account’s purpose efficiently.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Add emojis.</strong></p><p>Almost every TikTok bio contains an emoji that help you emphasize your brand’s personality and showcase your brand’s services and products without consuming much space in your TikTok bio.</p><p>For example, if you work for an eCommerce brand, particularly in clothing, you might enter a t-shirt emoji (???). Or, if your company sells video tools, you may enter a video camera emoji (???).</p><p>So, these emojis tell people what to do. And, if you want them to hit the follow button or click the link below, you could add arrows to express that without entering extra characters to influence visitors’ action.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Add a CTA.</strong></p><p>Like any attractive social media bio, you should have a CTA in your TikTok bio as well. It exactly tells your visitors what to do next. For example, you might add a CTA to direct followers to an eCommerce website, a blog post link, or another social channel like YouTube or Instagram.</p><p>Always think of including a CTA in almost every video or communication you share with your potential followers.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Don’t exceed the character limit</strong>.</p><p>TikTok has a bio character limit which is further not very big. So you only have 80 characters to summarize your TikTok bio. That’s just over half of the limit present on Instagram handles, which can be pretty tight, one of the factors emojis are super helpful. You can easily save your characters and use them wisely to communicate your brand among the followers fully. Then, pick out the most crucial angles of your brand and showcase those in your TikTok bio.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Add a link in your TikTok bio.</strong></p><p>TikTok gives you a link adding space as well, so if it’s currently accessible in your account, you should use it. And, we’ll also discuss how to add a link to TikTok’s bio, an excellent method to direct traffic off the platform to other promotion pages.</p><p>So, you can direct them to a relevant landing page or e-book and capture their contact info or an email address, or you can share the sales page for the most current product you touted in your video.</p><p>Thus, there are numerous ways you can optimize your TikTok bio ideas.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Link-to-TikTok-Bio-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Link-to-TikTok-Bio-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?"></a>Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?</h2><p>First, to know how to add a link to TikTok bio, you can send traffic to only a single URL. You can select your most recent blog post, a dedicated landing page, your homepage, social media profile, or any other page you’d like.</p><p>The other way is to promote multiple links through a bio service. With this type of service, people can get directed to a web page with a collection of page links to visit.</p><p>You could include affiliate links, blog links, products, or even your other social media handles. Using a TikTok bio link service helps you to give your visitors more ways of connecting with people outside of TikTok.</p><p><strong>Accessing the Link in Bio on TikTok</strong></p><p>Yet, there is a caveat to the <strong>TikTok bio</strong> link option: not everyone can add a link to their <strong>TikTok bio</strong>. Most Android users have this option, while some iOS users are still waiting. Follow the steps below to check:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Hit the <strong>“Edit your profile”</strong> tab</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Check for the option “<strong>Website</strong>“ underneath the section to edit TikTok bio.</p><p>There’s no issue if you don’t have that option. You can join the TikTok Testers program by easily downloading a separate app called <strong>Testflight</strong> through the app store.</p><p>Next, open your current TikTok app and tap the three dots in your profile page’s upper right-hand corner to enter the “<strong>Settings</strong>“ window. Then, scroll down and click <strong>“Join TikTok Testers.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-beta.jpg"                      alt="tiktok beta"                ></p><p>Follow those instructions, and you’ll be able to access the different Beta versions of TikTok after they get released.

You have to go through the five easy steps to create a bio for TikTok that will help you be successful. So, let’s dig deeper into those ultimate steps!</p><p><strong>Step 1: Describe your brand.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/describe-account-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="describe account tiktok"                ></p><p>Source: blog.hubspot.com</p><p>Describe your followers who you are and what you do. They may gather some idea of what your profile is about, based on your content. Still, it would help if you didn’t rely on that.</p><p>What if you create a video relevant to you but has nothing to do with your account? Your visitors need to learn another way to know what your business is all about.</p><p>It can be only a few words, so make sure you boil down what people want to know. And ensure your language is compelling, engaging, and gets across your account’s purpose efficiently.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Add emojis.</strong></p><p>Almost every TikTok bio contains an emoji that help you emphasize your brand’s personality and showcase your brand’s services and products without consuming much space in your TikTok bio.</p><p>For example, if you work for an eCommerce brand, particularly in clothing, you might enter a t-shirt emoji (???). Or, if your company sells video tools, you may enter a video camera emoji (???).</p><p>So, these emojis tell people what to do. And, if you want them to hit the follow button or click the link below, you could add arrows to express that without entering extra characters to influence visitors’ action.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Add a CTA.</strong></p><p>Like any attractive social media bio, you should have a CTA in your TikTok bio as well. It exactly tells your visitors what to do next. For example, you might add a CTA to direct followers to an eCommerce website, a blog post link, or another social channel like YouTube or Instagram.</p><p>Always think of including a CTA in almost every video or communication you share with your potential followers.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Don’t exceed the character limit</strong>.</p><p>TikTok has a bio character limit which is further not very big. So you only have 80 characters to summarize your TikTok bio. That’s just over half of the limit present on Instagram handles, which can be pretty tight, one of the factors emojis are super helpful. You can easily save your characters and use them wisely to communicate your brand among the followers fully. Then, pick out the most crucial angles of your brand and showcase those in your TikTok bio.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Add a link in your TikTok bio.</strong></p><p>TikTok gives you a link adding space as well, so if it’s currently accessible in your account, you should use it. And, we’ll also discuss how to add a link to TikTok’s bio, an excellent method to direct traffic off the platform to other promotion pages.</p><p>So, you can direct them to a relevant landing page or e-book and capture their contact info or an email address, or you can share the sales page for the most current product you touted in your video.</p><p>Thus, there are numerous ways you can optimize your TikTok bio ideas.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Link-to-TikTok-Bio-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Link-to-TikTok-Bio-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?"></a>Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?</h2><p>First, to know how to add a link to TikTok bio, you can send traffic to only a single URL. You can select your most recent blog post, a dedicated landing page, your homepage, social media profile, or any other page you’d like.</p><p>The other way is to promote multiple links through a bio service. With this type of service, people can get directed to a web page with a collection of page links to visit.</p><p>You could include affiliate links, blog links, products, or even your other social media handles. Using a TikTok bio link service helps you to give your visitors more ways of connecting with people outside of TikTok.</p><p><strong>Accessing the Link in Bio on TikTok</strong></p><p>Yet, there is a caveat to the <strong>TikTok bio</strong> link option: not everyone can add a link to their <strong>TikTok bio</strong>. Most Android users have this option, while some iOS users are still waiting. Follow the steps below to check:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Hit the <strong>“Edit your profile”</strong> tab</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Check for the option “<strong>Website</strong>“ underneath the section to edit TikTok bio.</p><p>There’s no issue if you don’t have that option. You can join the TikTok Testers program by easily downloading a separate app called <strong>Testflight</strong> through the app store.</p><p>Next, open your current TikTok app and tap the three dots in your profile page’s upper right-hand corner to enter the “<strong>Settings</strong>“ window. Then, scroll down and click <strong>“Join TikTok Testers.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-beta.jpg"                      alt="tiktok beta"                ></p><p>Follow those instructions, and you’ll be able to access the different Beta versions of TikTok after they get released.

You have to go through the five easy steps to create a bio for TikTok that will help you be successful. So, let’s dig deeper into those ultimate steps!</p><p><strong>Step 1: Describe your brand.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/describe-account-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="describe account tiktok"                ></p><p>Source: blog.hubspot.com</p><p>Describe your followers who you are and what you do. They may gather some idea of what your profile is about, based on your content. Still, it would help if you didn’t rely on that.</p><p>What if you create a video relevant to you but has nothing to do with your account? Your visitors need to learn another way to know what your business is all about.</p><p>It can be only a few words, so make sure you boil down what people want to know. And ensure your language is compelling, engaging, and gets across your account’s purpose efficiently.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Add emojis.</strong></p><p>Almost every TikTok bio contains an emoji that help you emphasize your brand’s personality and showcase your brand’s services and products without consuming much space in your TikTok bio.</p><p>For example, if you work for an eCommerce brand, particularly in clothing, you might enter a t-shirt emoji (???). Or, if your company sells video tools, you may enter a video camera emoji (???).</p><p>So, these emojis tell people what to do. And, if you want them to hit the follow button or click the link below, you could add arrows to express that without entering extra characters to influence visitors’ action.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Add a CTA.</strong></p><p>Like any attractive social media bio, you should have a CTA in your TikTok bio as well. It exactly tells your visitors what to do next. For example, you might add a CTA to direct followers to an eCommerce website, a blog post link, or another social channel like YouTube or Instagram.</p><p>Always think of including a CTA in almost every video or communication you share with your potential followers.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Don’t exceed the character limit</strong>.</p><p>TikTok has a bio character limit which is further not very big. So you only have 80 characters to summarize your TikTok bio. That’s just over half of the limit present on Instagram handles, which can be pretty tight, one of the factors emojis are super helpful. You can easily save your characters and use them wisely to communicate your brand among the followers fully. Then, pick out the most crucial angles of your brand and showcase those in your TikTok bio.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Add a link in your TikTok bio.</strong></p><p>TikTok gives you a link adding space as well, so if it’s currently accessible in your account, you should use it. And, we’ll also discuss how to add a link to TikTok’s bio, an excellent method to direct traffic off the platform to other promotion pages.</p><p>So, you can direct them to a relevant landing page or e-book and capture their contact info or an email address, or you can share the sales page for the most current product you touted in your video.</p><p>Thus, there are numerous ways you can optimize your TikTok bio ideas.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Link-to-TikTok-Bio-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Link-to-TikTok-Bio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?"></a>Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?</h2><p>First, to know how to add a link to TikTok bio, you can send traffic to only a single URL. You can select your most recent blog post, a dedicated landing page, your homepage, social media profile, or any other page you’d like.</p><p>The other way is to promote multiple links through a bio service. With this type of service, people can get directed to a web page with a collection of page links to visit.</p><p>You could include affiliate links, blog links, products, or even your other social media handles. Using a TikTok bio link service helps you to give your visitors more ways of connecting with people outside of TikTok.</p><p><strong>Accessing the Link in Bio on TikTok</strong></p><p>Yet, there is a caveat to the <strong>TikTok bio</strong> link option: not everyone can add a link to their <strong>TikTok bio</strong>. Most Android users have this option, while some iOS users are still waiting. Follow the steps below to check:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Hit the <strong>“Edit your profile”</strong> tab</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Check for the option “<strong>Website</strong>“ underneath the section to edit TikTok bio.</p><p>There’s no issue if you don’t have that option. You can join the TikTok Testers program by easily downloading a separate app called <strong>Testflight</strong> through the app store.</p><p>Next, open your current TikTok app and tap the three dots in your profile page’s upper right-hand corner to enter the “<strong>Settings</strong>“ window. Then, scroll down and click <strong>“Join TikTok Testers.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-beta.jpg"                      alt="tiktok beta"                ></p><p>Follow those instructions, and you’ll be able to access the different Beta versions of TikTok after they get released.

The food is not just visually appealing but is good enough to serve your guests.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Viral-TikTok-Food-Recipes-You-Should-Know"><a href="#Top-10-Viral-TikTok-Food-Recipes-You-Should-Know" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Viral TikTok Food Recipes You Should Know"></a>Top 10 Viral TikTok Food Recipes You Should Know</h2><p>The TikTok viral food recipes and hacks have taken the world by the storm, especially since everyone has turned a home chef since the pandemic. There is a myriad of recipes floating on the internet, but not all of them are worthy of your time.</p><p>But, the other half have not just pleasantly surprised us but have also made way to our kitchens and our staple diet. Starting off on TikTok, these recipes gained popularity and then were introduced to Instagram and Youtube. So, if you still haven’t seen any one of these recipes, you can follow the link to the recipe video and recreate recipes. So, without wasting any more time, let us see the top 10 viral TikTok recipes:</p><h3 id="1-Dalgona-Coffee"><a href="#1-Dalgona-Coffee" class="headerlink" title="1. Dalgona Coffee"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SjCEOWd3PU" >Dalgona Coffee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Dalgona Coffee is not such a new phenomenon. It originated in the 1960s, but it was only recently that this fantastic coffee recipe got viral on TikTok. Dalgona Coffee is a mixture of water, sugar, and coffee that is whipped until the ground coffee turns caramel. The whipped coffee is then topped with iced milk, and it is ready to drink.</p><p>As 2020 began and the pandemic isolated us all in our homes, it was cooking we all turned to. Dalgona coffee is one of the top trends of that period. It all began when Korean actor Jung Il-woo shared his top-secret recipe in a program called “Stars’ Top Recipe at Fun-Staurant.” After that, many TikTokers started recreating their own version of the recipe until it became a trend.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/1-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="dalgona coffee-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="2-Accordion-Potatoes"><a href="#2-Accordion-Potatoes" class="headerlink" title="2.

Perhaps that is why accordion potatoes became such a big trend on TikTok. Another reason for their popularity was that they could be excellent midnight or mid-morning snack that could be prepared in quick few steps.</p><p>Accordion potatoes can be used to elevate your potato side dish, and you can munch on them any time you want. While TikTok food influencers all made their own versions of the accordion potato, the fun part about this recipe is that you can easily alter it to your taste. Garnish it with salt, spices, garlic, or mayo; there are just too many versions to count.</p><p>The recipe is very easy, and even the dicing is not that difficult with numerous hacks available. Once diced, dip it into flour, fry it, and enjoy!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/2-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="accordion potatoes-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="3-Quesadilla-from-a-Tortilla"><a href="#3-Quesadilla-from-a-Tortilla" class="headerlink" title="3.

This recipe has been circulating all over the internet, with everyone trying their own luck and getting amazed.</p><p>The Quesadilla from a tortilla was first discovered when a TikTok user <a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@crystalscookingfun?lang=en" >crystalscookingfun <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> posted a video of a round tortilla. She cut a single slit from the radius till the edge. Then she added a different ingredient in each of the quadrants and folded the tortilla in the shape of a quarter. She then placed it in a panini press, and Voila!</p><p>This recipe became a hit, and everyone began creating quesadillas with different ingredients. There were sweet ones and savory ones, including breakfast wraps, dessert wraps, and so much more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/3-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="Quesadilla from a tortilla-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="4-Spicy-Vodka-Pasta-by-Gigi-Hadid"><a href="#4-Spicy-Vodka-Pasta-by-Gigi-Hadid" class="headerlink" title="4.

Sharing all the recipes with her followers, all of us were no less than entertained. One of these was the highly talked about spicy vodka pasta.</p><p>While it is almost every day a new pasta dish or a pasta hack comes out, it is tough to properly cook a good pasta dish that is infused with flavors.</p><p>This quick recipe only required a few ingredients. Supermodel Gigi Hadid added some butter, parmesan cheese, shallots, heavy cream, and vodka to create this beauty. The pasta is well worth its hype. However, if you like your flavors a little differently, then you can easily create your own version of this spicy pasta sauce.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/4-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="spicy vodka pasta by gigi hadid-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="5-Pesto-Eggs"><a href="#5-Pesto-Eggs" class="headerlink" title="5.

Pesto eggs are such a flavorful upgrade from regular eggs and an easy hack that cooks in no time. Apparently, even Hollywood actor Chris Evans is also a big fan of the pesto eggs.</p><p>To create pesto eggs, all you need to do is cook two tablespoons of pesto in a pan and then add two eggs to it. Let your eggs cook and flip them over to cook from the other side. Once cooked, you can eat your eggs as it is or serve them with toast.</p><p>You can also create your own pesto eggs by adding in some chili flakes and spices or avocados.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="pesto eggs-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="6-Two-Ingredient-Chocolate-Souffle"><a href="#6-Two-Ingredient-Chocolate-Souffle" class="headerlink" title="6.

This is no simple chocolate souffle. What makes this special is that it only requires two ingredients! All you need is a few eggs and a Nutella jar, and you can make your souffle anytime, anywhere.</p><p>Just separate egg whites from the yolks and then mix the yolks in the Nutella spread. Beat the egg whites until they are fluffy, and add them to the mixture. Then bake your souffle and serve it.</p><p>This is the perfect dessert for anyone who does not regularly indulge in cooking or is unfamiliar with cooking any other french delicacies. You can serve this to your guests or enjoy it yourself with a mug of coffee.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/6-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="2 ingredient chocolate souffle-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="7-Cloud-Bread"><a href="#7-Cloud-Bread" class="headerlink" title="7.

Cloud bread tastes just as delicious as it looks with its soft and fluffy texture.</p><p>To make cloud bread at home, all you need is three ingredients: egg whites, corn starch, and sugar. All you need to do is whip the egg whites, then add in the sugar and the cornstarch. Bake it and enjoy your cloud bread once the mixture looks like a meringue. Tear into your cloud bread and enjoy the fluffy goodness. You can layer the bread with some Nutella and jam and serve it for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.</p><p>In truth, cloud bread is the baked version of meringue, similar to macaroons or lemon meringue pie.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/7-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="cloud bread-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="8-Corn-Ribs"><a href="#8-Corn-Ribs" class="headerlink" title="8.

You can not only serve it as a side dish, but you can also serve it as a main course. If you are looking for a meat-free meal, we highly recommend trying corn ribs.</p><p>Corn ribs are very simple to make. You take a corn ear and vertically slice it into four long ribs. Make sure you are using the corn rib after you have cleaned all the silk and dirt from it. Next, you can brush some spices mixed it oil over it to add some flavor to the corn. You can add herbs, chili flakes, or honey glaze. Now the last step is cooking the corn. You may grill it, bake it or air-fry it. You can then top it off with some cilantro or cotija cheese.</p><p>To serve your ribs, you can make a delicious dip using mayonnaise, chipotle sauce, or simply enjoy it with ketchup.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/8-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="corn ribs-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="9-Hot-Cocoa-Bombs"><a href="#9-Hot-Cocoa-Bombs" class="headerlink" title="9.

If you love drinking hot cocoa on chilly nights and love being a little extra, then you will love these hot cocoa bombs.</p><p>These hot cocoa bombs are pretty similar to bath bombs.

Make sure you are using the corn rib after you have cleaned all the silk and dirt from it. Next, you can brush some spices mixed it oil over it to add some flavor to the corn. You can add herbs, chili flakes, or honey glaze. Now the last step is cooking the corn. You may grill it, bake it or air-fry it. You can then top it off with some cilantro or cotija cheese.</p><p>To serve your ribs, you can make a delicious dip using mayonnaise, chipotle sauce, or simply enjoy it with ketchup.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/8-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="corn ribs-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="9-Hot-Cocoa-Bombs-2"><a href="#9-Hot-Cocoa-Bombs-2" class="headerlink" title="9.

Perhaps that is why accordion potatoes became such a big trend on TikTok. Another reason for their popularity was that they could be excellent midnight or mid-morning snack that could be prepared in quick few steps.</p><p>Accordion potatoes can be used to elevate your potato side dish, and you can munch on them any time you want. While TikTok food influencers all made their own versions of the accordion potato, the fun part about this recipe is that you can easily alter it to your taste. Garnish it with salt, spices, garlic, or mayo; there are just too many versions to count.</p><p>The recipe is very easy, and even the dicing is not that difficult with numerous hacks available. Once diced, dip it into flour, fry it, and enjoy!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/2-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="accordion potatoes-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="3-Quesadilla-from-a-Tortilla-3"><a href="#3-Quesadilla-from-a-Tortilla-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

This recipe has been circulating all over the internet, with everyone trying their own luck and getting amazed.</p><p>The Quesadilla from a tortilla was first discovered when a TikTok user <a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@crystalscookingfun?lang=en" >crystalscookingfun <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> posted a video of a round tortilla. She cut a single slit from the radius till the edge. Then she added a different ingredient in each of the quadrants and folded the tortilla in the shape of a quarter. She then placed it in a panini press, and Voila!</p><p>This recipe became a hit, and everyone began creating quesadillas with different ingredients. There were sweet ones and savory ones, including breakfast wraps, dessert wraps, and so much more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/3-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="Quesadilla from a tortilla-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="4-Spicy-Vodka-Pasta-by-Gigi-Hadid-3"><a href="#4-Spicy-Vodka-Pasta-by-Gigi-Hadid-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

Sharing all the recipes with her followers, all of us were no less than entertained. One of these was the highly talked about spicy vodka pasta.</p><p>While it is almost every day a new pasta dish or a pasta hack comes out, it is tough to properly cook a good pasta dish that is infused with flavors.</p><p>This quick recipe only required a few ingredients. Supermodel Gigi Hadid added some butter, parmesan cheese, shallots, heavy cream, and vodka to create this beauty. The pasta is well worth its hype. However, if you like your flavors a little differently, then you can easily create your own version of this spicy pasta sauce.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/4-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="spicy vodka pasta by gigi hadid-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="5-Pesto-Eggs-3"><a href="#5-Pesto-Eggs-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

Pesto eggs are such a flavorful upgrade from regular eggs and an easy hack that cooks in no time. Apparently, even Hollywood actor Chris Evans is also a big fan of the pesto eggs.</p><p>To create pesto eggs, all you need to do is cook two tablespoons of pesto in a pan and then add two eggs to it. Let your eggs cook and flip them over to cook from the other side. Once cooked, you can eat your eggs as it is or serve them with toast.</p><p>You can also create your own pesto eggs by adding in some chili flakes and spices or avocados.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="pesto eggs-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="6-Two-Ingredient-Chocolate-Souffle-3"><a href="#6-Two-Ingredient-Chocolate-Souffle-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

This is no simple chocolate souffle. What makes this special is that it only requires two ingredients! All you need is a few eggs and a Nutella jar, and you can make your souffle anytime, anywhere.</p><p>Just separate egg whites from the yolks and then mix the yolks in the Nutella spread. Beat the egg whites until they are fluffy, and add them to the mixture. Then bake your souffle and serve it.</p><p>This is the perfect dessert for anyone who does not regularly indulge in cooking or is unfamiliar with cooking any other french delicacies. You can serve this to your guests or enjoy it yourself with a mug of coffee.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/6-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="2 ingredient chocolate souffle-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="7-Cloud-Bread-3"><a href="#7-Cloud-Bread-3" class="headerlink" title="7.

All you need to do is whip the egg whites, then add in the sugar and the cornstarch. Bake it and enjoy your cloud bread once the mixture looks like a meringue. Tear into your cloud bread and enjoy the fluffy goodness. You can layer the bread with some Nutella and jam and serve it for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.</p><p>In truth, cloud bread is the baked version of meringue, similar to macaroons or lemon meringue pie.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/7-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="cloud bread-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="8-Corn-Ribs-3"><a href="#8-Corn-Ribs-3" class="headerlink" title="8.

Discord servers are like a big group chat but with many more features. Music Bots allow users to listen to music while they play games or just chat with their friends. Discord Bots are created like a virtual Discord user. To listen to music you have to join a voice channel and then run a command specific to that bot to make it join the voice channel and start playing music.</p><p><strong>Discord music bots</strong> provide a way for multiple members of a server to listen to the same music at the same time.

Just go to the Website of whatever Music Bot you wish to add. Then all you need to do is click on the “Add to Discord” Button.</p><p>This will then take you to a page where it will ask for a server to enter and also list other things it’ll gain access to.</p><p>Just choose the server you wish to add the bot to from the drop-down menu and click continue.</p><p>After that, you’ll have to prove your humanity and that’s all. The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members’ area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the Members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members on the server.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?"></a>Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?</h2><p>Playing music on discord using a bot is as easy as pie. All you have to do is go to the website of your specific bot and look up the commands. In this example, we would be using Groovy Bot.</p><p>Another way to check commands is through your discord server. Type <em>–help</em> for Groovy and similarly for every other bot ([specified prefix]help). It will then state how you can check the commands for that bot.</p><p>Then in your Discord server after joining a voice channel, the type that commands with a link to a piece of music or the name (-play i dont think i love u anymore) if your bot allows that and the bot will join the voice channel and start streaming music.</p><p>You can also loop the song currently playing by typing the <em>–loop track</em> command. And loop your whole queue using –<em>loop queue</em>. You can turn the loop off by –<em>loop off</em>.</p><p>If you want to add another song to a queue, just use the same play command and Groovy will add that song next in the list. You can view your queue using the <em>–queue</em> command.</p><p>In the end no matter what bot you choose, it doesn’t matter as long as you have fun and love the features it provides. There are a lot more bots out there but in my opinion, these are the best, most famous, and most trustworthy providing the best music playback quality.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Create-Videos-for-Discord-in-Minutes"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Create-Videos-for-Discord-in-Minutes" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?"></a>Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?</h2><p>Since it is not allowed to upload files of more than 8MB on Discord, you need an perfect video tool for making videos in less size, it is better for you to use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmore Discord video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to share original music and videos on Discord in compressed size.

Discord servers are like a big group chat but with many more features. Music Bots allow users to listen to music while they play games or just chat with their friends. Discord Bots are created like a virtual Discord user. To listen to music you have to join a voice channel and then run a command specific to that bot to make it join the voice channel and start playing music.</p><p><strong>Discord music bots</strong> provide a way for multiple members of a server to listen to the same music at the same time. Discord music bots can find songs on YouTube, Spotify, or other platforms and play them on a Discord voice channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmora box"                ></p><p>Filmora Discord Video Editor</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-Discord-Video-Editor-1"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-Discord-Video-Editor-1" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora - Discord Video Editor"></a>Wondershare Filmora - <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Discord Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>• Create videos for Discord with a smaller size due to the 8MB restriction</p><p>• Edit audio files like denoise, crop, audio ducking, audio auto synchronization, etc…</p><p>• Cross-platform supported - (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-2-Top-10-Best-High-Quality-Music-Bots-For-Discord-1"><a href="#Part-2-Top-10-Best-High-Quality-Music-Bots-For-Discord-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Top 10 Best High-Quality Music Bots For Discord"></a>Part 2: Top 10 Best High-Quality Music Bots For Discord</h2><h3 id="1-Probot-1"><a href="#1-Probot-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Just go to the Website of whatever Music Bot you wish to add. Then all you need to do is click on the “Add to Discord” Button.</p><p>This will then take you to a page where it will ask for a server to enter and also list other things it’ll gain access to.</p><p>Just choose the server you wish to add the bot to from the drop-down menu and click continue.</p><p>After that, you’ll have to prove your humanity and that’s all. The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members’ area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the Members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members on the server.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord-1"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?"></a>Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?</h2><p>Playing music on discord using a bot is as easy as pie. All you have to do is go to the website of your specific bot and look up the commands. In this example, we would be using Groovy Bot.</p><p>Another way to check commands is through your discord server. Type <em>–help</em> for Groovy and similarly for every other bot ([specified prefix]help). It will then state how you can check the commands for that bot.</p><p>Then in your Discord server after joining a voice channel, the type that commands with a link to a piece of music or the name (-play i dont think i love u anymore) if your bot allows that and the bot will join the voice channel and start streaming music.</p><p>You can also loop the song currently playing by typing the <em>–loop track</em> command. And loop your whole queue using –<em>loop queue</em>. You can turn the loop off by –<em>loop off</em>.</p><p>If you want to add another song to a queue, just use the same play command and Groovy will add that song next in the list. You can view your queue using the <em>–queue</em> command.</p><p>In the end no matter what bot you choose, it doesn’t matter as long as you have fun and love the features it provides. There are a lot more bots out there but in my opinion, these are the best, most famous, and most trustworthy providing the best music playback quality.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Create-Videos-for-Discord-in-Minutes-1"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Create-Videos-for-Discord-in-Minutes-1" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?"></a>Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?</h2><p>Since it is not allowed to upload files of more than 8MB on Discord, you need an perfect video tool for making videos in less size, it is better for you to use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmore Discord video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to share original music and videos on Discord in compressed size.

Discord servers are like a big group chat but with many more features. Music Bots allow users to listen to music while they play games or just chat with their friends. Discord Bots are created like a virtual Discord user. To listen to music you have to join a voice channel and then run a command specific to that bot to make it join the voice channel and start playing music.</p><p><strong>Discord music bots</strong> provide a way for multiple members of a server to listen to the same music at the same time. Discord music bots can find songs on YouTube, Spotify, or other platforms and play them on a Discord voice channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmora box"                ></p><p>Filmora Discord Video Editor</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-Discord-Video-Editor-2"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-Discord-Video-Editor-2" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora - Discord Video Editor"></a>Wondershare Filmora - <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Discord Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>• Create videos for Discord with a smaller size due to the 8MB restriction</p><p>• Edit audio files like denoise, crop, audio ducking, audio auto synchronization, etc…</p><p>• Cross-platform supported - (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-2-Top-10-Best-High-Quality-Music-Bots-For-Discord-2"><a href="#Part-2-Top-10-Best-High-Quality-Music-Bots-For-Discord-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Top 10 Best High-Quality Music Bots For Discord"></a>Part 2: Top 10 Best High-Quality Music Bots For Discord</h2><h3 id="1-Probot-2"><a href="#1-Probot-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

Just go to the Website of whatever Music Bot you wish to add. Then all you need to do is click on the “Add to Discord” Button.</p><p>This will then take you to a page where it will ask for a server to enter and also list other things it’ll gain access to.</p><p>Just choose the server you wish to add the bot to from the drop-down menu and click continue.</p><p>After that, you’ll have to prove your humanity and that’s all. The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members’ area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the Members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members on the server.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord-2"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?"></a>Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?</h2><p>Playing music on discord using a bot is as easy as pie. All you have to do is go to the website of your specific bot and look up the commands. In this example, we would be using Groovy Bot.</p><p>Another way to check commands is through your discord server. Type <em>–help</em> for Groovy and similarly for every other bot ([specified prefix]help). It will then state how you can check the commands for that bot.</p><p>Then in your Discord server after joining a voice channel, the type that commands with a link to a piece of music or the name (-play i dont think i love u anymore) if your bot allows that and the bot will join the voice channel and start streaming music.</p><p>You can also loop the song currently playing by typing the <em>–loop track</em> command. And loop your whole queue using –<em>loop queue</em>. You can turn the loop off by –<em>loop off</em>.</p><p>If you want to add another song to a queue, just use the same play command and Groovy will add that song next in the list. You can view your queue using the <em>–queue</em> command.</p><p>In the end no matter what bot you choose, it doesn’t matter as long as you have fun and love the features it provides. There are a lot more bots out there but in my opinion, these are the best, most famous, and most trustworthy providing the best music playback quality.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Create-Videos-for-Discord-in-Minutes-2"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Create-Videos-for-Discord-in-Minutes-2" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?"></a>Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?</h2><p>Since it is not allowed to upload files of more than 8MB on Discord, you need an perfect video tool for making videos in less size, it is better for you to use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmore Discord video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to share original music and videos on Discord in compressed size.

Discord servers are like a big group chat but with many more features. Music Bots allow users to listen to music while they play games or just chat with their friends. Discord Bots are created like a virtual Discord user. To listen to music you have to join a voice channel and then run a command specific to that bot to make it join the voice channel and start playing music.</p><p><strong>Discord music bots</strong> provide a way for multiple members of a server to listen to the same music at the same time. Discord music bots can find songs on YouTube, Spotify, or other platforms and play them on a Discord voice channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmora box"                ></p><p>Filmora Discord Video Editor</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-Discord-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-Discord-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora - Discord Video Editor"></a>Wondershare Filmora - <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Discord Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>• Create videos for Discord with a smaller size due to the 8MB restriction</p><p>• Edit audio files like denoise, crop, audio ducking, audio auto synchronization, etc…</p><p>• Cross-platform supported - (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-2-Top-10-Best-High-Quality-Music-Bots-For-Discord-3"><a href="#Part-2-Top-10-Best-High-Quality-Music-Bots-For-Discord-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Top 10 Best High-Quality Music Bots For Discord"></a>Part 2: Top 10 Best High-Quality Music Bots For Discord</h2><h3 id="1-Probot-3"><a href="#1-Probot-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

Then all you need to do is click on the “Add to Discord” Button.</p><p>This will then take you to a page where it will ask for a server to enter and also list other things it’ll gain access to.</p><p>Just choose the server you wish to add the bot to from the drop-down menu and click continue.</p><p>After that, you’ll have to prove your humanity and that’s all. The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members’ area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the Members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members on the server.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?"></a>Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?</h2><p>Playing music on discord using a bot is as easy as pie. All you have to do is go to the website of your specific bot and look up the commands. In this example, we would be using Groovy Bot.</p><p>Another way to check commands is through your discord server. Type <em>–help</em> for Groovy and similarly for every other bot ([specified prefix]help). It will then state how you can check the commands for that bot.</p><p>Then in your Discord server after joining a voice channel, the type that commands with a link to a piece of music or the name (-play i dont think i love u anymore) if your bot allows that and the bot will join the voice channel and start streaming music.</p><p>You can also loop the song currently playing by typing the <em>–loop track</em> command. And loop your whole queue using –<em>loop queue</em>. You can turn the loop off by –<em>loop off</em>.</p><p>If you want to add another song to a queue, just use the same play command and Groovy will add that song next in the list.
